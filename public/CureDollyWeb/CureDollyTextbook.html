<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Hi,</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Here are a couple of points
regarding this "textbook".</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">- If you don't know, Cure Dolly's
youtube playlist is highly praised in the Japanese learning
community.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">The two most popular textbooks Genki
and Tae Kim usually try to find parallels between Japanese and
english.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Cure Dolly's approach is to teach
Japanese from a Japanese point of view, which makes things more
logical.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Generally, the experience is to have
some practical or basic knowledge of japanese and when reading Cure
Dolly, things start to "click".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">I'm not sure how easy it is to start
with Cure Dolly from scratch though since after the first 20
lessons or so, things are less organized, and the approach is more
like "video of the week”.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">- One of the main issues that people
have with Cure Dolly is the presentation.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">The robot voice can be pretty
difficult to understand or downright unbearable for
some.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Given the value of the content, I
decided to make a textbook version using the transcripts as a
solution to this problem.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">I still included screenshots from
the video when visual cues were helpful.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">It also makes the whole thing more
appealing.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">There’s still the youtube link for
each version. If you watch the video, changing the speed, and using
the subs can make the experience more enjoyable.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">- All credit to Cure Dolly and fans
who made the transcript available on the channel.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span>The only edit I did to the text was to correct
some typos and to cut the last part that is often dedicated to
thanking</span> <span>patreons</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;and the
usual "like and subscribe" speech.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">However I encourage you to check the
video since more often than not you'll find valuable content in the
comment section.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">- Every lesson is available in this
textbook.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">However the text formatting and
screenshot inclusion is still in progress.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Some extra videos from the channel
are not included.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">You can still find the video list
with links to the channel below.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">- To make things easier to read, I'm
changing the romaji from the transcript to japanese.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">However, even though I'll go lesson
by lesson, I'll change all the same words at once.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So you will see sentences mixing up
romaji and japanese until I'm finished with all the
videos.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Apologies for that.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span>Any issue or idea for improvement you can reach
out on</span> <span class="c42"><a class="c7" href=

Lesson 1: Japanese made easy! What schools never teach. The core
Japanese sentence -organic Japanese</a></span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Hello, everyone.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">My name is Cure Dolly and I am here
to teach you Organic Japanese.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">What is Organic Japanese? It is
Japanese pure and simple, with no harmful additives.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Japanese is the simplest, the most
logical, the most easily understandable language I have ever
encountered – much easier than Western languages.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">But you wouldn't know that if you
try to learn it from Western textbooks or Japanese learning
websites.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Why not? Because they don't teach
Japanese structure.They teach English structure and then try to
force Japanese into it.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And it doesn't fit, and it doesn't
work very well.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">That is the main reason, I think,
why so many people give up Japanese.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">The Western system makes it seem
complicated, full of strange exceptions and odd rules that you have
to memorize.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And none of this is true if you
learn the language the way it really is.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So, this course is not just for
people beginning Japanese.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">It's very good for those people –
this is the best way to start.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">But if you've been learning Japanese
for a while and you find yourself getting confused by things, it
would be very good to watch this series and learn from the start
the way Japanese should have been explained in the first
place.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">All right, let's get
started.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<h2 class="c22" id="h.ajf89xo41fjk"><span class="c16">The japanese
core sentences</span></h2>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">The most basic thing about Japanese
is the Japanese core sentence.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Every Japanese sentence is
fundamentally the same.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">It has the same core.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">What does it look like? It looks
like this.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">We're going to picture it as a
train.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Every Japanese sentence has these
two elements: A and B.</span></p>
<p class="c19 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span style=
"overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 624.00px; height: 350.67px;">
<img alt="" src="images/image152.jpg" style=
"width: 624.00px; height: 351.00px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: -0.17px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);"
title=""></span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">The main carriage and the
engine.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">The engine is what makes the
sentence move, what makes it work.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">The carriage has to be there because
without the carriage there's nothing for the engine to
move.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Those two things are the core of
every Japanese sentence.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And if you can understand this, you
can understand every sentence, no matter how complicated it
becomes.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Later on we'll have a lot more
carriages.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">We can say more about A; we can say
more about B; we can combine logical sentences together to make
complex sentences.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">But every Japanese sentence conforms
to this basic type.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So, what are A and B?</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Let's begin by reminding ourselves
that in any language whatsoever there are only two kinds of
sentences.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And they are:</span></p>
<ul class="c13 lst-kix_sp2cs7u8coo5-0 start">
<li class="c17 c30 li-bullet-0"><span class="c1">A is B
sentences</span></li>
<li class="c17 c30 li-bullet-0"><span class="c1">A does B
sentences.</span></li>
</ul>
<p class="c19"><span style=
"overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 624.00px; height: 350.67px;">
<img alt="" src="images/image365.jpg" style=
"width: 624.00px; height: 350.67px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);"
title=""></span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So an A does B sentence is "Sakura
walks".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span>An A</span> <span>is B</span><span class=
"c1">&nbsp;sentence is "Sakura is Japanese".</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And we can put these into the past
tense; we can put them in the negative; we can turn them into
questions; we can say more about A; we can say more about
B.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">But, ultimately, every sentence
boils down to one of these: an A is B or an A does B
sentence.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So let's look at how we do this in
Japanese.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">In Japanese, if we want to say
"Sakura walks" (A does B: Sakura walks), then A is Sakura, the main
carriage, and B is walks, the thing she does, the engine of the
sentence.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Walk in Japanese is "歩く
(歩く)".</span></p>
<h2 class="c22" id="h.69hw0kldkaqf"><span class="c16">The particle
が</span></h2>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And we need one more thing to make
the core Japanese sentence, and that is the linchpin of every
sentence, and it's が (ga).</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Now I want you to make friends with
が, because this is the center of Japanese grammar.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Every Japanese sentence revolves
around が.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span>And the first part of the reason that
Japanese</span> <span>gets</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;so confused
with the way it's taught in textbooks is that they don't properly
explain this.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">In some sentences we're not going to
be able to see the が, but it's always there, and it's always doing
the same job.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">That may sound a little complicated,
but it isn't.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">It's very simple, and I'm going to
explain that in the next lesson.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">For now, let's just stick with the
very simplest kind of sentence.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So here is が.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span style=
"overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 624.00px; height: 350.67px;">
<img alt="" src="images/image6.jpg" style=

title=""></span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">It looks like a post with a big hook
on it, doesn't it? It links together A and B and turns them into a
sentence.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<h2 class="c22" id="h.q9are6tp10pn"><span class="c16">The Verb
sentences</span></h2>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So, our core A does B sentence is
"さくらが 歩く":</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Sakura walks".</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span style=
"overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 624.00px; height: 350.67px;">
<img alt="" src="images/image118.jpg" style=

title=""></span></p>
<h2 class="c22" id="h.bxen1jqp5a63"><span class="c16">The Copula
Sentences</span></h2>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Now let's take an A is B sentence:
"Sakura is Japanese", or, as we say, "Sakura is a Japanese
person".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So, A again is Sakura, B is 日本人
(nihonjin), which means Japanese person, and once again we needが to
link them together.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span style=
"overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 624.00px; height: 350.67px;">
<img alt="" src="images/image151.jpg" style=
"width: 624.00px; height: 350.67px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);"
title=""></span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So we're going to picture the A car,
the main carriage, with aが on it, because the main carriage, the
subject of the sentence, always carries a が, to link it to the
engine.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span>So,
“さくらが</span><span>&nbsp;日本人</span><span class="c1">"– and we need
one more thing.</span></p>
<h2 class="c22" id="h.3f19ik4oqwb2"><span class="c16">The copula
だ</span></h2>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">There's one other thing that I want
you to make friends with, and that's だ (da).</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"さくらが 日本人 だ" :</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Sakura is a Japanese
person".</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span style=
"overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 624.00px; height: 350.67px;">
<img alt="" src="images/image52.jpg" style=
"width: 624.00px; height: 350.67px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);"
title=""></span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Now, you may have met this だ in its
fancy form, です, but there are very good reasons for learning the
plain, simple form first.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So we're going to learn
だ.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Now if you look at だ, it's like an
equals sign boxed off to the left.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And this is a perfect mnemonic for
what it does, because だ tells us that A is B.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Why is it boxed off to the left?
Because it only works one way.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Think about this
logically:</span></p>
<p class="c0 c28"><span class="c1">さくらが 日本人 だ</span></p>
<p class="c0 c28"><span class="c1">Sakura = Japanese
person.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">But it doesn't work the other
way:</span></p>
<p class="c0 c28"><span class="c1">Japanese people are Sakura –
they're not all Sakura.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Sakura is a Japanese person, but a
Japanese person is not necessarily Sakura.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So now we have an A is B sentence
and an A does B sentence.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">There is one more form of the
Japanese core sentence, for it has three forms.</span></p>
<h2 class="c22" id="h.584tblp7cvvz"><span class="c16">The Adjective
Sentences</span></h2>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">The third form is when we have a
describing word, an adjective.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">In Japanese, describing words ends
with い (i), just as they often do in English: happy, sunny, cloudy,
silly.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">In Japanese it's just the
same:</span></p>
<p class="c0 c28"><span class="c1">happy – 嬉しい
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;sad – 悲しい
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;blue
– 青い.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Now, we don't have to learn all
these, but we do need to know about Japanese adjectives ending in i
because they make the third kind of sentence.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So let's take an easy one: ペン
(that's a nice easy word because it means pen).</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"ペンが 赤い".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Pen is red".</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span style=
"overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 624.00px; height: 350.67px;">

title=""></span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Now, you notice that we don't have a
だ on this sentence.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Why is that? Because the い-Adjective
赤い (red) – it doesn't mean red, it means is-red.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">The だ function, the equals function,
is built into those い-Adjectives.</span></p>
<h2 class="c22" id="h.myxnr5ei3uv5"><span class=
"c16">Summary</span></h2>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So those are the three forms of
Japanese sentences.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span style=
"overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 624.00px; height: 350.67px;">

title=""></span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">They all start with the subject of
the sentence, they're all connected with が, and they can end in
three ways:</span></p>
<ul class="c13 lst-kix_g1oua57tps8c-0 start">
<li class="c17 c30 li-bullet-0"><span class="c1">with a verb, which
will end in う</span></li>
<li class="c17 c30 li-bullet-0"><span class="c1">with the copula,
だ</span></li>
<li class="c17 c30 li-bullet-0"><span class="c1">with an い because
the last word is an adjective.</span></li>
</ul>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And now you know the basics of
Japanese.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span>And although this is very very basic, you
already know some things that the textbooks never teach you, and
you have already overcome one of the problems that makes Japanese
get so very very complicated.</span></p>

Lesson 2: Core Secrets. Japanese made easy - unlocking the "code".
Learn Japanese from scratch</a></span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">みなさん、 こんにちは.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Last week, we learned how every
Japanese sentence has the same core.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">The main carriage and the
engine.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">A and B. The thing we are talking
about and the thing we are saying about it.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And I told you that we can have a
lot more carriages as sentences become more complex, but they still
always have the same core.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Now we are going to look at some of
those extra carriages.</span></p>
<h2 class="c22" id="h.8emxv8fx1n51"><span class="c16">The invisible
carriage</span></h2>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And the first one we're going to
look at is a very mysterious carriage, but it's also a very very
very important one.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Part of the reason that so many
people find Japanese confusing, vague and difficult is because they
are never properly taught about this carriage.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">What does it look like? Well, I told
you before that while every sentence has the same two core
elements, you can't always see both of them.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">You can always see the engine, but
sometimes you can't see the main carriage.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Why not? When you can't see it, it's
because of this.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">This is the invisible
carriage.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And while you can't see it, it's
always there.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And understanding that it's always
there is the key to understanding Japanese.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So, what is the invisible carriage?
In English, the closest equivalent is "it".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So, let's begin by seeing what
"it"does in English.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Let's take this sentence:</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c39"><span class="c52 c31">" the ball rolled down the
hill. When the ball got to the bottom, the ball hit a sharp stone.
The ball was punctured and all the air came out of the
ball."</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Now, would anybody ever say that? Of
course they wouldn't, because once we have established what we are
talking about, we replace it with "it".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So we say:</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c39"><span class="c31 c52">" the ball rolled down the
hill. When it got to the bottom, it hit a sharp stone. It was
punctured and all the air came out of it."</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Now, let's suppose a small child
tries to say this and says,</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c39"><span class="c31">" b</span><span class="c31">all
rolled</span> <span class="c31">down hill</span><span class="c31">,
got</span> <span class="c31">to bottom</span><span class=
"c31">,</span> <span class="c31">hit sharp</span><span class=
"c37 c31">&nbsp;stone, got punctured, all the air came
out."</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Now, is that difficult to
understand? No, it isn't difficult at all, is it? Because in fact
we don't need to use this "it"marker every time, over and over
again.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">English grammar demands it, but
there's no actual communicative need to do it.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span>And
Japanese</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span>doesn't</span><span class=
"c1">&nbsp;do it.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">In place of "it"– which actually
means nothing because it can mean anything.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">If I say "it", I may be talking
about a flower or about the sky. I may be talking about a tree, or
my finger, or the Eiffel Tower or the Andromeda galaxy.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"It"in itself doesn't mean anything:
you know what "it"is from context.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So, if a small child, or even an
adult, comes down to the kitchen at night and someone sees her, she
might say:</span></p>
<p class="c39"><span class="c31">"Got really hungry.</span>
<span class="c31">Came</span><span class="c37 c31">&nbsp;for
something to eat."</span></p>
<p class="c39 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Again, there's nothing confusing or
difficult about this.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">She means:</span></p>
<p class="c39"><span class="c31 c37">"I got really hungry. I came
down for something to eat."</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">In English this isn't a proper
sentence, but in Japanese it is.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">All those little pronouns, like
"it", "she", " he", "I", "they", in Japanese can be replaced by the
invisible carriage, the zero pronoun.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">But the important thing to remember
is that they are still there.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">All right.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So let's look at this at work in
Japanese.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">I might say, "Dolly だ" , and that
means "I am Dolly".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So the full sentence is, "zeroが
Dolly だ".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So this looks as if it only has an
engine and no main carriage, but the main carriage is simply the
invisible one.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span style=

<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And we can say that "I"is the
default value of the zero pronoun, the invisible

<p class="c0"><span class="c1">However, the context can define it
as anything.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">For example, if we hear a rustling
in the woods and look over in the direction of it, and I
say,</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"うさぎ だ！" that means, "zeroが うさぎ だ！",
"It is a rabbit!".</span></p>

<p class="c0"><span class="c1">It, that thing we just looked
toward, rustling in the trees, that's a rabbit.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">If I say, "土曜日 だ" (土曜日 means
Saturday), I'm saying "It is Saturday".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">What's "it"? Today ­– "today is
Saturday"­– "It is Saturday".</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>

title=""></span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">All these sentences are full,
complete Japanese sentences, with the が marked subject, the A
carriage (the main carriage) and the engine.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">But in each of these cases, the main
carriage is invisible ­­– but it's still there.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Now, it may seem a little bit like
splitting hairs to insist that it isn't being left out, it actually
is there.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">But it's important to understand
this.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">It's important at this stage, but it
will become much more important as sentences become more
complex.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Without this piece of information,
they're going to start sounding extremely vague and hard to
grasp.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So now, let's start looking
step-by-step at how sentences can become more complex.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And then let's see how it all fits
together at this stage.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<h2 class="c22" id="h.34q0tm61i2ge"><span class="c16">The particle
を</span></h2>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">I'm going to introduce you to one
more kind of carriage and that is an を car.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">This means a noun marked by the
particle を.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">It is sometimes said "wo" and more
usually just "お".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And if you know the English
grammatical term "object", which means the thing we're doing
something to, it's a good mnemonic to remember that "お" stands for
"object".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So the を car looks like this, and as
you can see, it's white.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span style=
"overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 624.00px; height: 350.67px;">
<img alt="" src="images/image251.jpg" style=
"width: 624.00px; height: 350.67px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);"
title=""></span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">It's white because it's not part of
the core train.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">The core train always consists of
just two elements, the engine and the main carriage.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">When we see white cars, we know that
they're telling us something more about the engine or about the
main carriage.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So let's take a sentence here: "私が
&nbsp;ケーキを 食べる".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">This means "I eat cake".</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span style=
"overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 624.00px; height: 350.67px;">
<img alt="" src="images/image61.jpg" style=
"width: 624.00px; height: 350.67px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);"
title=""></span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Now, the core sentence here is "I
eat". Those are the two black carriages.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">The white carriage, "ケーキを", is
telling us more about the engine.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">The core sentence is "I eat" and
"ケーキを" is telling us what it is that I eat.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Now, the interesting thing here is
that we may often see this said like this: "ケーキを 食べる".</span></p>
<p class="c19 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span style=
"overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 624.00px; height: 350.67px;">
<img alt="" src="images/image1.jpg" style=
"width: 624.00px; height: 350.67px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);"
title=""></span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And I think you already know what's
going on when this happens.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">This is another case where we have
the invisible A car.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">We can't have a sentence without a
が.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">We can't have an action being done
without a doer.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span>If we say "ケーキを 食べる"</span><span>,
what</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;we're really saying is "zeroが
&nbsp;ケーキを 食べる".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And the default value for "zero",
for the invisible carriage, is "私".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So usually this is going to be "I
eat cake", although if you were talking about someone else at the
time, it might mean that that person eats cake.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">All right. Thank you for attending
this lesson.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span>Class dismissed.</span></p>

Lesson 3: WA-particle secrets schools don't ever teach. How WA can
make or break your Japanese</a></span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">こんにちは. Welcome to Lesson
3.</span></p>
<h2 class="c22" id="h.xjz7l3dxnv6y"><span class="c16">The particle
は</span></h2>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Some of you who have done some
Japanese already may be wondering how I've managed to get through
two entire lessons without using or even mentioning the は (wa)
particle.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">I'm well aware that most courses
start you on は from the beginning.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"私は アメリカ人 だ."</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"ペンは 青い."</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And this is really a very very bad
idea because it leaves you completely unclear about what the
particles really do and about the logical structure of
sentences.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">However, we're now ready to look at
the は particle and find out what it does and, just as important,
what it doesn't do.</span></p>
<h3 class="c11" id="h.wqqolze68csw"><span class="c29">What it
isn’t</span></h3>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">The は particle can never be a part
of the core sentence.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">It can never be one of the black
carriages, the main car A (the thing we are saying something about)
or the engine B (the thing we are saying about it).</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span style=
"overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 624.00px; height: 350.67px;">

title=""></span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">It can't be a white car either,
because white cars like the を (wo) car, are part of the logical
structure of the sentence.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span style=
"overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 624.00px; height: 350.67px;">

title=""></span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And a は-marked noun is never part of
the logical structure of a sentence.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">は is a non-logical
particle.</span></p>
<h3 class="c11" id="h.asfus8tzqy9g"><span class="c29">What it
is</span></h3>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So if は is not a black car or a
white car, what kind of a carriage is it? Well, it's not a carriage
at all. A は-marked noun looks like this…</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span style=
"overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 624.00px; height: 350.67px;">
<img alt="" src="images/image292.jpg" style=
"width: 624.00px; height: 350.67px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);"
title=""></span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">That's right, it's a
flag.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Why do we depict it as a flag?
Because that is what は does.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">It flags something as the topic of
the sentence.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">It doesn't say anything about
it.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">That's what the logical sentence is
there for. は simply flags the topic.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Now, some of the textbooks will tell
you that a sentence like "私は アメリカ人 だ" literally means "as for me, I
am an American", and that is exactly correct.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">If they would stick with that logic
and carry it through, we wouldn't have the trouble we
have.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So, "私は" means "as for
me".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"アメリカ人 だ" means "=American"or "am
American".</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span style=
"overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 624.00px; height: 350.67px;">
<img alt="" src="images/image50.jpg" style=
"width: 624.00px; height: 350.67px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);"
title=""></span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So as you see, with a sentence like
this something is missing, both from the Japanese and the
English.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">We can't say "as for me, am
American".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Neither can we have a sentence
without an A car, without a が-marked doer.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So if we put the A car in, it makes
sense in both English and Japanese.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span style=
"overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 624.00px; height: 350.67px;">

title=""></span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"私は &nbsp;zeroが アメリカ人 だ" - " as for
me, I am an American."</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Now, some of you may be saying,
"Isn't it over-complicated? Can't we just pretend that '私は' is the
main car of the sentence?" And the answer to that is
"no".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Because although it works in this
case and some other cases, it doesn't work in every case and that
is why we really mustn't do it.</span></p>
<h3 class="c11" id="h.ozyt1i9qsa42"><span class="c29">は doesn’t
mean “=”</span></h3>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Let's take an example. There's an
old joke among Japanese learners and it's only possible because of
how badly Japanese is taught.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">The joke is: A group of people are
dining in a restaurant and they're discussing what they're going to
eat, and somebody says, "私は うなぎ だ".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Unagi means eel, so the joke is that
this person has literally said, "I am an eel".</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span style=
"overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 624.00px; height: 350.67px;">

title=""></span></p>
<p class="c19 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">After all, if "私は アメリカ人 だ" means "I
am an American", then "私は うなぎ だ" must mean "I am an
eel".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">That's absolutely perfect logic –
except that "私は アメリカ人 だ" doesn't mean "I am an American". It means
"as for me, I am an American".</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span>As we know, the default value of the invisible
car, the zero pronoun, is "私", but that isn't</span>
<span>its</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;only value. Its value
depends on context.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">In "私は アメリカ人 だ" (" as for me, I am
an American") the value of the zero pronoun is indeed
"私".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">But in "私は うなぎ だ" , which is "私は
zeroが うなぎ だ" , zero is not "私". Zero is "it".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"It"is the thing we are talking
about, the subject of the conversation: what we are eating for
dinner.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And this is going to affect all
kinds of sentences as we become more advanced in
Japanese.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So what we are going to do now is
take another one of the cars and look at that and then see how it
all works together with wa.</span></p>
<h2 class="c22" id="h.3gatzoj25e3w"><span class="c16">The particle
に</span></h2>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">The car we're going to introduce
today is a white car, and this is the に (ni) car.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">It makes a kind of trio with が (ga)
and を (wo).</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">In "a does B"sentences,が tells us
who does the doing, を tells us what it is done to, and に tells us
the ultimate target of that doing.</span></p>

<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Now, we don't always have a を; we
don't always have a に.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">But let's take this を
sentence:</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span>"私</span><span>が ボール</span><span>を</span>
<span>投げる."</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">ボール is ball and 投げる means throw. So
this is, "I throw a ball".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">The core sentence is "I throw" – "私が
投げる", and the white car tells us what I threw: it was a
ball.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span>Now</span><span>, if</span><span class=
"c1">&nbsp;we say, "私が ボールを Sakuraに 投げる", this means "I throw a
ball at Sakura" (or "to Sakura").</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Sakura is the destination, the
target, of my throwing.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span style=
"overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 624.00px; height: 350.67px;">

title=""></span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And it's very important to note here
that it is the logical particles – が, を and に – that tell us what
is happening.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">The order of the words doesn't
really matter the way it does in English.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">What matters is the logical
particle.</span></p>
<h2 class="c22" id="h.x7pkvx627vs1"><span class="c16">Logical /
non-logical particle</span></h2>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So if I say, "私に さくらが ボールを 投げる", I'm
saying, "Sakura throws the ball at me".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">If I say, "ボールが 私に Sakuraを 投げる", I'm
saying, "the ball throws Sakura at me".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">It doesn't make any sense, but we
might want to say it in a fantasy novel or something.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">We can say whatever we like in
Japanese so long as we have the logic of the particles
correct.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">But now let's introduce は into this
sentence.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"私は Sakuraに ボールを 投げる." This is "私は
zeroが Sakuraに ボールを 投げる".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">As we know, what it means is "as for
me, I throw the ball at Sakura".</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span style=
"overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 624.00px; height: 350.67px;">

title=""></span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Now let's give the は to the ball:
"ボールは 私が Sakuraに 投げる." What we are saying now is "as for the ball,
I throw it at Sakura".</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span style=
"overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 624.00px; height: 350.67px;">

title=""></span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">The important thing to notice here
is that when we change a logical particle from one noun to another
we change what's actually happening in the sentence, but when we
change the non-logical particle は from one noun to another – I can
change it from me to the ball – it makes no difference to the logic
of the sentence.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">It makes a difference to the
emphasis: I'm now talking about the ball, "as for the ball..." what
happens to the ball is that I throw it at Sakura, but who is doing
what, and what they are doing it with and what they are doing it
to, none of that changes when you change the は particle and that's
the difference between a logical and a non-logical
particle.</span></p>

Past, present and future tense</span></h1>

Lesson 4: Japanese past, present, and future tense. How Japanese
verb tenses really work</a></span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">こんにちは.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Today we're going to talk about
tenses.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Up to now, we've only been using one
tense, and that is the one represented by the plain dictionary form
of verbs: 食べる (eat), 歩く (walk), and so forth.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">To use natural sounding Japanese, we
need three tenses.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">You might think they would be past,
present and future, but in fact they're not.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">The one we've been using up to now
is not a present tense.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">It's called the non-past tense, and
a lot of people think this is confusing.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Why can't Japanese have a simple
present tense like English instead of something vague and
mysterious like a non-past tense? Well, actually it isn't confusing
at all, and what makes it confusing is, for a change, not the fact
that Japanese is taught in a strange way, but the fact that English
is taught in a strange way.</span></p>
<h2 class="c22" id="h.39jhd0rykmmm"><span class="c16">The Non-past
tense</span></h2>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">The truth is that the Japanese
non-past tense is very similar to the English non-past
tense.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">What is the English non-past tense?
Well, it is the plain dictionary form of English words: eat, walk,
etc.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Why do I call it a non-past tense?
Well, let's take an example.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Suppose you get a message on your
けいたい saying, "I walked to the cafe and now I eat cafe and drink
coffee".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">What would you know about the person
who sent that message? Well, you'd know that it was not a native
English speaker, wouldn't you? Because no native English speaker
says "I eat cake and I drink coffee" when they mean "I am eating
cake and drinking coffee right now".</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">When do we say "I eat cake"? Well,
we might say it when we mean that we eat cake sometimes: "I eat
cake. I'm not one of these people who doesn't eat cake. I do eat
cake. Whenever there's any cake around, I eat it. But that doesn't
mean I'm eating cake right at this moment."</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">When else do we use the English
non-past plain form of verbs? Well, sometimes we use them for
future events: "Next week I fly to Tokyo.""Next month I have an
exam." and sometimes we use them for something that's going on
right now, but not mostly.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">For example, in a literary
description: "the sun sinks over the sea and a small happy robot
runs across the beach." but that isn't the way we use it most of
the time in everyday speech, is it? So, the Japanese non-past tense
is very similar in the way it functions to the English non-past
tense.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">If you understand one you can pretty
much understand the other.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Most of the time, the Japanese
non-past tense refers to future events.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"犬が 食べる" - "the dog will-eat" ;
"さくらが 歩く" - "Sakura will walk."</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">The way we've been using it up to
now - "Sakura walks"- is possible, but it isn't the most natural
way.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">We've been using it that way because
it was the only tense we knew.</span></p>
<h2 class="c22" id="h.7j8z0av3pmnw"><span class="c16">The Present
tense</span></h2>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">If we want to say something more
natural, like "Sakura is walking", what do we do? Well, what do we
do in English? In English we say, don't we, "Sakura IS
walking".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">We use the word "to be". You can "BE
walking".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Sakura IS walking" ; "we ARE
walking."</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Fortunately, in Japanese we don't
have all these different forms of the word "to be".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">We use the same word every time, and
the word is "いる".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"いる" means "be" in relation to
animals and people, and to make this continuous present tense, we
always use "いる".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So, "Sakura is walking" – "さくらが
歩いている".</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span style=

title=""></span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Dog is eating" – "犬が 食べて
いる."</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Now, let's notice that in a sentence
like "犬が 食べて いる" we have something we haven't yet seen, and that's
a white engine.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">A white engine is an element that
could be an engine but in this case it's not the engine of this
sentence.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">It's modifying, or telling us more
about, one of the core elements of the sentence.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So, the core of this sentence is "犬が
いる" - "the dog is".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">But the dog isn't just existing –
the dog is doing something.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And that white engine tells us what
it is doing.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">It is "eating".</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span style=
"overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 624.00px; height: 350.67px;">
<img alt="" src="images/image252.jpg" style=
"width: 624.00px; height: 350.67px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);"
title=""></span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And we're going to see this white
engine structure over and over again as we go deeper into
Japanese.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And just as in English we don't say
"the dog is eat", we use a special form of the verb that goes along
with the verb of being.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So in English we say "is walking",
"is eating".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">In Japanese we say "食べて いる", "歩いて
いる".</span></p>
<h3 class="c11" id="h.5gdpkuapor55"><span class="c29">How to form
the て-form</span></h3>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Now, how do we form this "て"-form,
which is the form we use for making the continuous present? With a
word like "食べる", it's very easy indeed.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">All we have to do is take off the
"る" and put "て" in its place.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">The bad news is that with other
verbs, we do have slightly different ways of attaching the
"て".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Apart from the plain ru-form, there
are four other ways.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">The textbooks will say five, but in
fact two of them are so similar that we can treat them as
four.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And I've made a video on exactly
what these ways are.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And I think it makes it much simpler
than most explanations.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So it's very important to watch that
so that you can learn how to form the continuous present
tense.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">The good news: it's perfectly
regular.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Once you know the ending of a verb
you also know how to put the "て" onto it.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">The only one that's a bit tricky is
る-ending verbs, but the video will explain that.</span></p>
<h2 class="c22" id="h.2586yblevrcn"><span class="c16">The Past
tense</span></h2>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So, how do we put things into the
past tense? Fortunately that's very easy indeed.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">All we do is add "た"– that's the
whole thing.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So, "犬が 食べる" – "dog will-eat" / "犬が
食べた" – "dog ate".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Now, there are different ways of
attaching "た" to different kinds of verb, verbs with different
endings, but the good news here is that they are exactly the same
as the ways that you attach "て".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So once you've learned the ways that
"て" attaches, you've also learned the ways that "た"
attaches.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So if you watch that て-form video,
you'll be able to do both the continuous present and the
past.</span></p>
<h2 class="c22" id="h.vgxfzc4qnn74"><span class="c16">The Future
tense</span></h2>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Now, there's one more thing about
time expressions that I think is useful to learn now.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">If we want to make it clear, when we
say "私は ケーキを 食べる", that we're talking about a future event, we can
say "明日" (which means "tomorrow") "明日 ケーキを 食べる".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">That's all we have to do.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">We just say "tomorrow" before we say
the rest of the sentence, just as we do in English.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"tomorrow I'm going to eat cake" –
"明日 ケーキを 食べる".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Now, "tomorrow" is what we call a
"relative time expression" because it's relative to
today.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Today is yesterday's
tomorrow.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And with all relative time
expressions like that: yesterday, last week, next year, and so
forth, times that are relative to the present time, we just do what
we did then.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">We put the time expression at the
beginning of the sentence and that puts that whole sentence into
that time.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span style=
"overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 624.00px; height: 350.67px;">

title=""></span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">However, when we have an "absolute
time expression", an expression that is not relative to the
present, such as Tuesday or six o'clock, then we have to use
"に".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Tuesday is "火曜日" and we may may say
"火曜日に ケーキを 食べる" – "On Tuesday I will eat cake."</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span style=
"overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 624.00px; height: 350.67px;">

title=""></span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">The important thing here is that it
can seem a bit complicated to have to work out, "Is the time
absolute or relative?" And the good thing to know here is that it's
not complicated at all, because it works exactly the same as
English.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span>In English, we say, "tomorrow I eat cake",
"Next week, I have an exam", and so forth, but when we use an
absolute time expression we say, "</span><span class=
"c26">On</span><span>&nbsp;Monday I will eat cake",
"a</span><span class="c26">t</span><span>&nbsp;six o'clock I have
an exam"; if we're talking about a month we say,
"</span><span class="c26">In</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;July I'm
going to Tokyo".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Now, Japanese works in exactly the
same way except that we don't have to remember when we're using
"on", when we're using "at' and when we're using "in".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">In Japanese we use "に" every
time.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">But in English when we need one of
those little words, on, in or at, then we need "に" in
Japanese.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And when we don't, then we don't
need "に" in Japanese.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">English and Japanese are identical
in that respect.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So rather than sitting down to work
out "Is this relative, or is this absolute?", just think whether
you need an on, in or at in English, and if you do, you need "に" in
Japanese.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And if you don't, you don't need "に"
in Japanese.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">It's really as simple as
that.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>

Lesson 5: Japanese verb groups and the te-form. Verb groups 1, 2, 3
made easy. Organic Japanese</a></span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Today we're going to talk about
Japanese verb groups.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Japanese verbs fall into three
groups, and these don't matter except when we're going to make some
change in the form of the verb. But because we do that pretty
often, it's important to understand the three groups.</span></p>
<h2 class="c22" id="h.esptoedvjo9z"><span class="c16">Verb
Groups</span></h2>
<h3 class="c11" id="h.j0jrbyb17zw0"><span class=
"c29">Ichidan</span></h3>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">The first group of Japanese verbs is
called ichidan verbs or "one-level" verbs.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Some people call them "ru-verbs",
which is a very silly name.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">If you're going to call them
anything like that, we should probably call them "いる / える
verbs".</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">They are the simplest and most basic
kind of verb.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">When we want to make any change, we
always do it the same way.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">All we do is take the る off the end
and put on whatever we want to put on.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Ichidan verbs can only end with
either -いる or える, that's to say, with one of the kana from the
i-row or one of the kana from the え-row plus る .</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>

<h3 class="c11" id="h.sal82rr6gvqc"><span class=
"c29">Godan</span></h3>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">The second group of verbs is by far
the largest and any ending that a verb can have, verbs in this
group can have.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Verbs always end with the u そう nd,
but not all u-kana can make the end of a verb, but a lot of them
can and all of them can make godan verbs.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span>They are called godan (五段) verbs, or
"five-level" verbs, for reasons that we'll see shortly, and as I
say they can end in any u そう nd,</span> <span class="c26">including
-いる or える</span><span class="c1">.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span>Unlike ichidan verbs, they can also end</span>
<span>in おる</span><span class="c1">, ある or うる.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So the only time we have any
ambiguity is when we have a verb ending in -いる or える.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Most of those verbs are ichidan
verbs, but there is a substantial minority of いる/える-ending godan
verbs.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span style=

title=""></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">It's not as difficult to
differentiate them as you might think, and I've made a video on
that, although it's a little bit more advanced than this
lesson.</span></p>
<h3 class="c11" id="h.rrrzdkalxr5u"><span class=
"c29">Irregular</span></h3>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">The third group of verbs is
irregular verbs, and the good news here is that there are only two
of them.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">You know those pages and pages of
irregular verbs in your Spanish or French textbook? Well, Japanese
has just two.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">There are a couple of other verbs
that are irregular in just one small respect, but very
few.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">The irregular verbs are 来る (come)
and する (do).</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span style=

<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<h2 class="c22" id="h.zcn42c71q9ej"><span class="c16">Conjugation て
/ た forms</span></h2>
<h3 class="c11" id="h.3dmyzjqtxn9i"><span class="c29">Ichidan (いる,
える)</span></h3>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So now that we know the three
groups, we're going to take a look at how you make them into the て
and た-form.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">As I explained last week, we need
those two forms for making the Japanese present and past
tenses.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And they have a number of other uses
too, which we'll learn as we go along with this course.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And as I demonstrated last week,
ichidan verbs are always very easy.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">You never do anything except take
off the る and put on whatever you're going to put on, in this case
a て or a た.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Godan verbs have five kinds of
possible ending – that's why they're called godan verbs: five-level
verbs.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And although that seems a little bit
difficult, it really isn't.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">We can combine two of the levels
anyway, because they are so close that we only need to learn them
once.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And I'm going to go through the main
groups.</span></p>
<h3 class="c11" id="h.vqzadmgunj8e"><span class="c29">Godan (う, つ,
る)</span></h3>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">The first group is what I call the
Utusuru verbs.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Those are the verbs ending in う, つ
and る .</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">The word うつる in Japanese – if you
don't know it, now is a good time to learn it – うつる means to move
from one thing to another, and that's exactly what we're doing here
– moving our verbs from one type to another.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So the verbs which end in う, つ and る
all transform in the same way to the て-form.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span>We take off the う, the つ or the る , and we
replace it with a small つ (っ) plus</span> <span>て
(or</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;た in the た-form). So:</span></p>
<ul class="c13 lst-kix_8cpsyki3nwla-0 start">
<li class="c17 c30 li-bullet-0"><span class="c1">笑う (laugh) becomes
笑って</span></li>
<li class="c17 c30 li-bullet-0"><span class="c1">持つ (hold) becomes
持って</span></li>
<li class="c17 c30 li-bullet-0"><span class="c1">取る (take) becomes
取って</span></li>
</ul>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span style=
"overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 624.00px; height: 350.67px;">
<img alt="" src="images/image189.jpg" style=
"width: 624.00px; height: 350.67px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);"
title=""></span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span>Now</span><span>, you</span><span class=
"c1">'ll notice that うつる has つ in the middle.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And the て-form of the うつる verbs is
formed by using a small つ plus that て.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">It's the only group that has つ in
it, and it's the only group that has a つ in the て-form
ending.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So it's really easy to
remember.</span></p>
<h3 class="c11" id="h.thy36bpiryrm"><span class="c29">Godan (ぬ, ぶ,
む)</span></h3>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">The second group is what I call the
NEW BOOM group.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">In Japanese when something is really
taking off, when it's becoming popular, we call it a ブーム (BUUMU).
That's an English word, isn't it? Buumu, a New Buumu! So, this
group I call the New Boom group because there isn't a Japanese word
that you can make out of nu, bu and mu that I know of,.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">What I want you to notice about this
group of verbs is that they all end in what I would call a dull
sound – ぬ, む, ぶ.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">It's not a sharp sound like す, つ, く,
and it's not a neutral sound like る or う.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">It's a dull sound – ぬ, む,
ぶ.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And this is important because the
ending is also a dull sound.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">The て-form ending is んで, the た-form
is んだ.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So:</span></p>
<ul class="c13 lst-kix_4ye6rqoh0hps-0 start">
<li class="c17 c30 li-bullet-0"><span class="c1">死ぬ (die), the only
ぬ ending verb, becomes 死んで / 死んだ</span></li>
<li class="c17 c30 li-bullet-0"><span class="c1">飲む (drink) becomes
飲んで / 飲んだ</span></li>
<li class="c17 c30 li-bullet-0"><span>遊ぶ
(play)</span><span>&nbsp;becomes</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;遊んで/
遊んだ.</span></li>
</ul>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So that's the New Boom group, the
dull-ending verbs.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And because only a limited number of
the possible kana can be used as a verb ending, they include all
the dull sounds except for ぐ.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">We'll come to that right
now.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span style=

title=""></span></p>
<h3 class="c11" id="h.xgvxjkl70o5u"><span class="c29">Godan (く,
ぐ)</span></h3>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">I told you that two of the groups
could be combined, and that is the く and ぐ group.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span>To make the て-form of a く ending
verb</span><span>, we</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;cut off the く
and add いて, or いた in the た form.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span>So
歩く</span><span>&nbsp;(walk</span><span>)</span><span>&nbsp;becomes</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;歩いて
/ 歩いた.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Now, if we have a 〃 (〃) on that く,
to make it into a ぐ, it's exactly the same, except that there is
also a 〃 on the て-ending.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So:</span></p>
<ul class="c13 lst-kix_u6itnnjv3cwq-0 start">
<li class="c17 c30 li-bullet-0"><span class="c1">歩く (walk) becomes
歩いて, but</span></li>
<li class="c17 c30 li-bullet-0"><span>泳ぐ
(swim)</span><span>&nbsp;becomes</span><span class=
"c1">&nbsp;泳いで.</span></li>
</ul>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">But, as you see, the two are more or
less identical.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">It's just that if there's a 〃 on the
original verb, there's a 〃 on the て-form too.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span>歩く</span><span>, 歩い</span><span class="c1">て;
泳ぐ, 泳いで.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span style=

<h3 class="c11" id="h.y3a6vbwfy3ta"><span class="c29">Godan
(す)</span></h3>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And now we just have one left, and
that is す.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And verbs ending in す drop the す and
add して.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span style=
"overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 624.00px; height: 350.67px;">

title=""></span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">As you will notice, if you have
followed our last lesson, we are just doing that regular thing of
shifting the す kana to its i-row equivalent, し.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span style=
"overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 624.00px; height: 350.67px;">

title=""></span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span>So 話す (talk) becomes 話して; the ます helper
verb</span><span>, which</span><span>&nbsp;turns verbs into formal
verbs</span><span>, in</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;the past tense
becomes ました.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So now we have all the godan
verbs.</span></p>
<h3 class="c11" id="h.v05fef1zr6sq"><span class="c29">Irregular
(くる, する, いく)</span></h3>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;Now, we are just going to look
at the exceptions.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">There are only three altogether: our
two irregular verbs and one other small one.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And these are very
simple.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">来る (come) becomes 来て; する (do)
becomes して.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And 行く – the verb 行く (to go) –
because it ends in く, you would expect it to become 行いて, but it
doesn't, it becomes 行って.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span style=

Lesson 6: Japanese "Adjectives" - the real secret that makes them
easy. What schools never teach.</a></span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Today we are going to talk about
adjectives.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Now, Japanese adjectives are not the
same thing as English adjectives.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">As we know, Japanese sentences come
in three fundamental kinds, depending on the kind of engine they
have.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">We have the U-Train, verb sentences;
the DA-Train, noun sentences; and the I-Train, which is the
so-called adjectival sentences.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span style=
"overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 624.00px; height: 350.67px;">

title=""></span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">But the truth is that any one of the
three kinds of engine can be used like an adjective.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So let's start off with the most
obvious one, the one that's called "adjective"in
English.</span></p>
<h2 class="c22" id="h.sxywzynvv6tv"><span class="c16">Adjective
Sentences</span></h2>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">A simple I-Train sentence is "ペンが
赤い".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">As you know, "赤い" doesn't mean
"red", it means "is-red".</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span style=
"overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 624.00px; height: 350.67px;">

title=""></span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Now, we can turn this black engine
white and put it behind the pen.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Now we have "赤い ペンが".</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span style=
"overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 624.00px; height: 350.67px;">

title=""></span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"赤い ペン" means "is-red pen" or, as we
say in English, "red pen".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">As you see, this isn't a full
sentence in itself any more because a white engine doesn't pull the
train, it just tells us more about whatever it is sitting
behind.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So "赤い" , once it becomes a white
engine, is just telling us more about the main car of the sentence,
which is "pen".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And if we want to make it into a
full sentence, we have to have a new engine.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So, let's take "小さい" , which means
"is-small".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"赤い ペンが 小さい" – "the red pen is
small".</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span style=
"overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 624.00px; height: 350.67px;">

<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So that's simple enough.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<h2 class="c22" id="h.hn3mspqvs8l4"><span class="c16">Verb
Sentences</span></h2>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Now let's look at verbs.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Any U-Engine, any verb, in any
tense, can be used like an adjective.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span>So</span><span>,
we</span><span>&nbsp;can</span> <span>say,</span><span class=
"c1">&nbsp;"少女が 歌った".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"歌った" means "sang".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span>The word for sing is "歌う", so the
た-form</span><span>, as</span><span>&nbsp;we know from our last
lesson</span><span>, is</span><span class=
"c1">&nbsp;"歌った".</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span>"少女が 歌った" – "the girl sang", and if we turn
that engine white and put it behind the girl</span><span>,
we</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;have "歌った 少女" – "the girl who
sang".</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span style=
"overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 527.50px; height: 296.72px;">
<img alt="" src="images/image199.jpg" style=

title=""></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And of course, once again this isn't
a sentence.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">But we can put in into any sentence
we like, such as "歌った 少女が 寝ている" – "the girl who sang is
sleeping".</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span style=
"overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 624.00px; height: 350.67px;">

title=""></span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And this is terribly important
because a lot of Japanese is structured this way.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">We can use entire verb-sentences as
adjectivals if we want to, and this happens very often.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">For example, "犬が 辞書を 食べた" – "the dog
ate the dictionary".</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span style=
"overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 624.00px; height: 350.67px;">
<img alt="" src="images/image23.jpg" style=
"width: 624.00px; height: 350.67px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);"
title=""></span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">We can turn this around to "辞書を 食べた
犬" – "the dog who ate the dictionary".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Or we can say, "犬が 食べた 辞書" – "the
dictionary that was eaten by the dog".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And then this can build into the
full sentence, "辞書を 食べた 犬が やんちゃ だ".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"やんちゃ" is a noun that means
"naughty"or "bad", so, "the dog who ate the dictionary is
bad".</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span style=
"overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 624.00px; height: 350.67px;">

title=""></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c33 c26 c55">Note</span><span class=
"c6 c33">: The う-Engine should be a だ-Engine</span></p>
<h2 class="c22" id="h.nkjvvkmx48ej"><span class="c16">Noun
Sentences</span></h2>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">This brings us to the
noun-engine.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">If we just say "犬が やんちゃ だ", we have
a simple noun sentence.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span style=
"overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 624.00px; height: 350.67px;">
<img alt="" src="images/image75.jpg" style=
"width: 624.00px; height: 350.67px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);"
title=""></span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">But we can turn this engine as well
into a white engine and put it behind the dog.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">But there is one change we have to
make.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">When we turn "だ" or "です" into a
white engine, when we connect it to anything, it changes its form
from "だ" to "な".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So we say "犬が やんちゃ だ", but we say
"やんち 犬", which is the same as saying "やんちゃだ 犬" – "is-bad dog / the
dog that is bad / the bad dog".</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span style=
"overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 624.00px; height: 350.67px;">

title=""></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So we can say "やんちゃな 犬が 寝ている" – "the
bad dog is sleeping".</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span style=
"overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 624.00px; height: 350.67px;">

title=""></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Now, the important thing to note
here is that you can't do this with every noun.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">There are only some nouns that are
frequently used in an adjectival way, that you can use in the way
we showed here.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">These are what the textbooks call
"な-adjectives", and it's a slightly confusing term, because as we
see they are in fact nouns, but they are a certain class of
noun.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Can we use other nouns as
adjectives? Yes, we can, but we use them in a somewhat different
way and they aren't engines.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">To explain this we have to introduce
a new type of car for our train.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And this is the の car.</span></p>
<h2 class="c22" id="h.abxavtd854p1"><span class="c16">The particle
の</span></h2>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">の (no) is a very simple particle
because it works exactly like apostrophe-s ['s] in
English.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So, "Sakuraの ドレス" means "Sakura's
dress".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"私の 鼻" means "my nose".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Luckily, we don't have to worry
about things like "my" and "your" and " her" and " his" in
Japanese; we always just use "の".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span style=
"overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 624.00px; height: 350.67px;">
<img alt="" src="images/image316.jpg" style=
"width: 624.00px; height: 350.67px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);"
title=""></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Now, because "の" is the possessive
particle, it can be used in another, slightly different
way.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">At the beginning of my older videos,
I always used to say, "KawaJapa no Kyua Doriい です" – "I am
KawaJapa's Cure Dolly".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">In other words, KawaJapa is the
group or party or website that I belong to.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And we can use this more widely for
defining the group or class to which anything belongs.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So, "赤い" means "red" because we can
turn the noun "赤" into the adjectival form "赤い".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">But we can't do that with all
colors.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">For example, "ピンク色".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"色" means "color", and we say
"ピンク色", that means "pink".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">But that doesn't have an
い-form.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And it doesn't count as an
adjectival noun, a な-adjective, as they are called in English,
either.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So what we do with it is, we use
"の".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">" ピンク色の ドレス" – "pink
dress".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span style=
"overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 624.00px; height: 350.67px;">
<img alt="" src="images/image229.jpg" style=
"width: 624.00px; height: 350.67px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);"
title=""></span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And this means "dress belonging to
the class of pink things".</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">If we want to say "Oscar the
Rabbit", we say "うさぎの オスカー ", which literally means "rabbit's
Oscar", and what it means is "Oscar who belongs to the class
'rabbit' ".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"ゼルダの伝説" means "the legend of Zelda"
; "伝説の 戦士" means "legendary warrior / warrior who belongs to the
class of legendary things".</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So we have four ways of forming
adjectivals: the three engines plus the の car.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And using this we can make all kinds
of sentences and they can become very complex, especially with
verbal adjectives in which we can use whole complex sentences in an
adjectival manner.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Now, one thing you may be thinking
is, "Since some nouns are used as adjectives with な and some with
の, do I have to start learning lists of which ones go with の and
which ones go with な?</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And my answer to that is, I don't
see any good reason to do so unless you are having to learn them
for an exam.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Why not? Well, look at it
logically.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">If you hear someone use them with
either "の" or "な", you're going to know what they're
saying.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">If you use them yourself and you get
it wrong, nobody is going to have any difficulty understanding what
you're saying, and it's a very small and typical foreigner's
mistake, and frankly I think it's the least of your worries at an
early stage.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">If you're writing, you can of course
look them up very easily.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">As you use Japanese more, hear more
Japanese, read more Japanese, you will pick up which ones are "の"
and which ones are "な".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And if you're not going to use
Japanese very much, well, why do you need to know? To me, Japanese
isn't a game of learning abstract information for no particular
reason.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span>It's a language that for the most part we can
learn in a natural manner, and understanding its real structure
helps us very greatly to do that.</span></p>

Lesson 7: Secrets of Japanese negative verbs, and Adjective
"conjugations"</a></span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Today we're going to talk about
negatives.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And in order to do that we're going
to have to introduce one of the fundamental secrets of Japanese
that the schools and textbooks almost never tell you.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And it makes the whole of Japanese
much much easier.</span></p>
<h2 class="c22" id="h.qom4l93l7zm5"><span class="c16">The adjective
ない</span></h2>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">But before we get to that, let's
look at the fundamental basis of Japanese negatives.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">The fundamental basis of negatives
is the adjective "ない".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">This adjective means "non-exist /
not-be".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">The word for "exist" for any object,
any inanimate thing, the sky, the sea, the universe, a grain of
rice, a flower, a tree, anything, is "ある".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So, if we want to say, "there is a
pen / A pen exists", we say "ペンが ある".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">But if we want to say there isn't a
pen, we say "ペンが ない".</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span style=
"overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 624.00px; height: 350.67px;">

title=""></span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Now, why do we use a verb for being
and an adjective for non-being? Because this happens throughout
Japanese.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Whenever we DO something we use a
verb.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Whether we walk, or sing, or run, or
anything – that's a verb.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">But if we don't do it, then we
attach "ない" to the verb and that becomes the engine of the
sentence.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So when we say we're not doing
something, we're not using a verb, we're using an
adjective.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Why is that? Because Japanese is
very logical.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">When we do something, an action is
taking place.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">That's a verb.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">But when we don't do it, no action
is taking place and we are describing a state of
non-action.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So, that's an adjective.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">All right.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So, if we want to say, "there is no
pen", we say "ペンが ない"</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">But what if we want to say, "this is
not a pen"?</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">That's not quite the same thing, is
it? So, how do we say that?</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span>If we want to say "this is a pen"</span><span>,
as</span><span>&nbsp;we know</span><span>, we</span><span class=
"c1">&nbsp;say "これは ("kore" – "this")... これは ペンだ".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">" as for this, pen = / As for this,
it's a pen."</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">But if we want to say, "this is not
a pen", we say, "これは ペンでは ない".</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span style=
"overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 624.00px; height: 350.67px;">

title=""></span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So what does that mean?</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;Well, the "で" is the て-form of
"だ" or "です".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So we still have "これは ペンだ" in the
form of "これは ペンで" and then we're attaching "ない".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So what we're saying is, "as for
this, as for being a pen, it isn't / This is not a pen".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">All right.</span></p>
<h2 class="c22" id="h.7stl52afb088"><span class="c16">Conjugation
Verbs Negative form</span></h2>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So now let's move on to the largest
part of this question, which is verbs.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">In order to put a verb into the
negative, we have to attach "ない" , and we do this by attaching it
to the a-stem.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">What does that mean? Well, let's
look at the stem system.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">The Japanese verb-stem system is the
simplest, the most logical and the most beautiful verb
transformation system in this world.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">It's almost absolutely
regular.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Once you know how to do it, you can
make any transformation (except for the て and た-form, which you
already know).</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">But the schools and textbooks don't
tell you this.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Instead of telling you this, they
present each "conjugation", as they call it (and they aren't in
fact conjugations)... they present each one as a separate case with
separate rules which appear to be random.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And because they don't tell you the
fundamental logic of the whole system, and because they describe
the changes that take place as if they were really written in the
Roman alphabet when they are written in kana, it really looks like
that.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Students really think they have to
treat each case as a separate case and learn separate rules in
every case.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And you don't have to.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">You just have to know the stem
system.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So let's look at it.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">As we've already learned, every verb
ends in one of the う-row kana.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So these kana in the red box are the
ones that can end a verb.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">It's not every う-row kana, but it's
most of them.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So we have verbs like "買う" (buy), "k
行く" (hear), "話す" (speak), "持つ" (hold) etc.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Now, as you can see, there are four
other possible ways in which a verb could end.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And each of those four ways is used,
and they are called the verb-stems.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Today we are only going to look at
the a-stem, because that's the one we need for the
negative.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span style=
"overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 624.00px; height: 350.67px;">

title=""></span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So, to form the a-stem, we simply
shift the last kana of the verb from the う-row to the
a-row.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So "k 行く" (hear) becomes "kika",
"話す" (speak) becomes " 話さ", "持つ" (hold) becomes "mota", and so
forth.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">There's only one exception in this
system – and when I say that I mean the whole system, all the stems
– there's only this one exception, which is that when a word ends
in the u-kana the stem doesn't change to "-a", it changes to
"wa".</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span style=
"overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 624.00px; height: 350.67px;">

title=""></span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So the negative of "買う" is not
"kaanai", it's "kawanai".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And it's only in the a-stem that we
have this exception, so that's the only exception in the whole
system, and I think you can see why it exists: "kaanai"is not as
easy to say as "kawanai", is it? All the others are perfectly
regular.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"聞く" (hear) becomes "聞かない"
(not-hear); "話す" (speak) becomes "話さない" (not-speak); "持つ" (hold)
becomes "持たない" (not hold), and so forth.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And as we already know, with ichidan
verbs, they only ever drop that "る "and put on whatever we want to
put on, so "食べる" (eat) becomes "食べない" (not-eat).</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span style=

title=""></span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And that's it.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">That's how we turn any verb
negative.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">It's very, very simple.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<h2 class="c22" id="h.yaoxu5i57hyk"><span class="c16">Adjective
Negative form</span></h2>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Now, what about adjectives? How do
we make adjectives negative?</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Well, when we make a transformation
to an adjective, what we always do is we turn the "-i"on the end of
it into "く": "赤い" (is-red) becomes "赤く" ; "かわいい" (is-cute) becomes
"かわいく"; 怖い (is-scary) becomes "怖く".</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And this is the way we make the
て-form of adjectives: "赤く" becomes "赤くて".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And it's also the way we make the
negative: "赤い" becomes "赤くない" (not-red).</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span style=
"overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 624.00px; height: 350.67px;">

title=""></span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Now interestingly, this く is the
opposite of what happens in the て-form, isn't it? If a word ends in
く, in the て-form we turn that く into い.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">But in an adjective we turn the い
into く.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">If we want to put an adjective into
the past tense, we take off the い and use かった.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So "こわい" (is-scary) becomes "こわかった"
(was-scary).</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And because "ない" is also an
い-Adjective, when we put that into the past we also say
"なかった".</span></p>
<h2 class="c22" id="h.o0wqknldbmbk"><span class="c16">Negative past
form</span></h2>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So, if we want to say "Sakura runs",
we say "さくらが 走る";</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">If we want to say "Sakura doesn't
run", we say "さくらが 走らない" ;</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">If we want to say "Sakura ran (in
the past)", we say "さくらが 走った" – because it's a godan
verb;</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And if we want to say "Sakura didn't
run (in the past)", we say "さくらが 走らなかった".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"走らない" , and then we put "ない" into
the past: "走らなかった".</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span style=

<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Now, as we all know.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"さくらが 走る" is rather unnatural
Japanese, just as it's rather unnatural English.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">We say "Sakura is running" in
English, and in Japanese we say "さくらが 走って いる".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So if we want to put all that in the
past, what do we do? Well, all we have to do is put that "いる" into
the past.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So we say "さくらが 走っていた" – "Sakura was
running".</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span style=

title=""></span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And if we want to say "Sakura wasn't
running", we say "さくらが 走っていなかった".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">That "いる" is a simple ichidan verb,
so we just drop the る and put on た or ない and, in the past,
なかった.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span style=

title=""></span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">I always say that Japanese is like
Lego.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Once you know the basic building
blocks you can build anything.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And there are almost no exceptions
in Japanese.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">In the whole of what we've been
talking about today there are really just two
exceptions.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And I'm going to introduce those so
that you know everything you need to know.</span></p>
<h2 class="c22" id="h.6989hrcvjx7e"><span class="c16">The helping
verb ます</span></h2>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">The only real exception to every
verb being made negative by adding "ない" is the verb "ます", which is
a helper verb that makes words formal.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">We add it to the い-stem of a verb,
and we will look at the い-stem later, but I think you can already
guess what it is.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So, "話す" becomes "話します", "聞く"
becomes "聞きます" and so on.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">When you put "ます" into the negative,
it does not become "masanai", as you would expect – it becomes
"ません".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Because it's formal, it's a bit
old-fashioned and it uses the old Japanese negative "sen" instead
of "ない".</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span style=

<h2 class="c22" id="h.dm4p3odmv15"><span class="c16">The
い-Adjective いい</span></h2>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">The only other apparent exception is
that いい, the adjective いい, which means "is-good", has an older
form, "よい" , which is still used quite often.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And when we make any transformation
to いい, it turns back to "よい" , so in the past tense we don't say
"いかった", we say "よかった"– and if you've seen much anime you've
probably heard this quite often.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span style=
"overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 624.00px; height: 350.67px;">

title=""></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"よかった", literally "zeroが よかった" – "It
was good / That turned out well / That's great".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And if you want to say something is
not good, you don't say "ikunai", you say "よくない".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And those are the only
exceptions.</span></p>

Lesson 8b: Japanese particles explained. How they REALLY
work.</a></span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">こんにちは.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Today we're going to get the key to
every Japanese sentence.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">We're going to do a round-up of the
logical particles – and the logical particles are the linchpins of
Japanese.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">With a full understanding of what
they do you can understand every Japanese sentence.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Without it, you can't.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And that's why the Japanese taught
by the textbook which doesn't explain the logical particles
correctly leaves most learners non-functional in Japanese even
after they've passed exams.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So, I'm going to do a round-up of
the logical particles we've learned so far and I'm going to
introduce the last major logical particle, which is the で
particle.</span></p>
<h2 class="c22" id="h.2dvso3qp1fz5"><span class="c16">Logical
particles and A-logical particles</span></h2>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">I'm going to do this with an analogy
of Detective work, because the logical particles essentially
interrogate the nouns in the sentence and show how they relate to
each other and to the verb of the sentence, and they give the
structure of the sentence.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And this is what a logical particle
is.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">People sometimes ask "what do you
mean by a logical particle?" we've already discussed the difference
between a logical particle and a non-logical
topic-marker.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span style=
"overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 624.00px; height: 350.67px;">

title=""></span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">A logical particle tells us how the
sentence logically holds together.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">It tells us who does what to whom,
with what, where, when and so forth.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">The は particle doesn't do this, it
just tells us what is the topic we're speaking about.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">There are other particles that I
would call a-logical.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">They're not non-logical topic
markers, but they're not logical particles either.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">For example, the particle と ands two
nouns together.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So if we say "Sakura と Maryが 歩いていた",
we're saying "Sakura and Mary were walking".</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span style=
"overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 624.00px; height: 350.67px;">

title=""></span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">The が particle tells us who was
doing the walking.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">The と particle simply ands those two
together.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">It doesn't tell us anything about
what they were doing, where they were going, or anything
else.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So, the logical particles are the
ones that tell us what is actually happening in the
sentence.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">The other thing to remember about
logical particles is that they always attach to a noun.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">If you see a logical particle
attaching to anything, you know that that word is in fact
functionally a noun.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And we must always see the noun plus
the particle attaching to it as an inseparable pair.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">The two work together.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">They are a question and an answer
which form a fundamental unit of a Japanese sentence.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">All right. So let's look at
this.</span></p>
<h2 class="c22" id="h.rvfe174uhu2"><span class="c16">Particles が,
を, に, へ</span></h2>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">The head of the Logical Particle
Detective Agency is Detective が.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">He is the Chief.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">He has to be in every
case.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">There can't be a sentence without が,
as we already know, although sometimes you can't see him because
he's in disguise, just like Sherlock Holmes is sometimes in
disguise.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">He also has powers that the other
logical particles do not have.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">He can work in A-is-B sentences,
that is, descriptive sentences, sentences that tell us what
something is, what its qualities are.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">The other particles can't do
that.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">They can only work in A-does-B
sentences, that is, sentences with a verb engine.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">To put it another way, while
Detective が works in the office with descriptive work, the other
detectives only work on cases, on actual actions, on incidents, on
verb-ending clauses.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So, let's look at them all at work
on a verb-ending clause.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Each of them has its own specific
questions.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span style=
"overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 624.00px; height: 350.67px;">

title=""></span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Detective が asks the fundamental
question: "who did it?" this is the fundamental question of any
sentence, and for that reason, only Detective が's carriage can be
black.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Because the core of every sentence
is "who did the action?" So が asks, "who was the actor? Who
dunnit?" and that forms the core of the sentence.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">The other logical particles ask
other questions about the incident which give us a complete picture
of the event.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">We won't usually see all of them in
any one sentence.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Detective を asks "who was it done
to? Who was the receiver of the action?"</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Detective に asks "where did he go?"
or "where is the weapon?" に asks where someone or something went to
or where it is.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Detective へ asks "In what direction
did he go?" Now, this is very close to Detective に's question,
isn't it? But we may not actually know where he went, so the answer
to that question could be north, south, east or west, and that's
the kind of question that Ni can't ask.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Or it could be " he went in the
direction of Sakura's house", and that's very close to the question
that に does ask.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So they overlap to quite a
degree.</span></p>
<h2 class="c22" id="h.86gc01i07bzu"><span class="c16">Particle
で</span></h2>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Now let's look at Detective
で.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Detective で asks the question "where
was it done?" and the question "with what was it done? What was the
weapon?" If we say "公園に いる", we're saying "I am in the
park".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">But if we want to say "I am playing
in the park", we have to say "公園で 遊んでいる", because to express that
we are doing something in a place rather than just being there, we
have to use で .</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And we also use で to express the
means (in terms of a noun) by which we do something.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So if we say "公園に 行く", we're saying
"I go to the park".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">But if we say "バスで 公園に 行く", we're
saying the means by which we go to the park, in this case a
bus.</span></p>

title=""></span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">If we say that we knocked in a
hammer with a nail or ate food with chopsticks, we use で for the
thing we did it with.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">If we say "日本語 を 話す", we're saying
"I speak Japanese", but if we say "日本語で 話す", we're saying "I speak
with Japanese/Japanese is the means by which I speak".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So this is equivalent in English to
saying "I speak in Japanese", but as you can see, the Japanese
construction is more logical because that actually is what we're
doing, we're speaking by the means of Japanese.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">The other question, of course, that
Detective に can ask is "who was the target of an action done to
something else?" but we've already discussed that in the に
lesson.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So this covers all the basic
functions of the main logical particles, and as you can see, these
are the particles that tell us what's going on in any Japanese
sentence.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">If we understand them, we can
understand the sentence; if we don't understand them, we
can't.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So if we get confused by the logical
particles, which we will if we take the textbooks seriously, we'll
have a lot of trouble understanding Japanese.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Don't confuse the particles and they
won't confuse you.</span></p>

Lesson 8: Location, purpose and transformation - keys to the ni
particle and he particle</a></span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">こんにちは.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Today we are going to talk about the
particle "に" , and in doing so we are going to level up.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">What do I mean by that? In the past
seven lessons we've learned quite a lot of basic Japanese
structure.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">We can say quite a lot of things now
if we have the vocabulary.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">But everything we can say is very,
very concrete.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">We can talk about doing things and
being things, which of course is the core of every
sentence.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">But we also need to have some more
sophisticated concepts at our disposal.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Things like purpose and intention
and transformation.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So today we're going to look at uses
of the に particle, some of which are very concrete still and some
of which begin to take us into those more sophisticated
areas.</span></p>
<h2 class="c22" id="h.qbnf2vi7a6k2"><span class="c16">に - Target of
an action</span></h2>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Now, we've already looked at the に
particle, haven't we? And we know that in a logical sentence it
marks the ultimate target of an action.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So "Sakuraに ボール を 投げた" means "I
threw the ball at Sakura".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span style=
"overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 624.00px; height: 350.67px;">
<img alt="" src="images/image84.jpg" style=
"width: 624.00px; height: 350.67px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);"
title=""></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">The ball is marked by を because it's
the thing I actually threw.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">I am marked by が whether you can see
me or not, because I am the one who did the action of
throwing.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">But Sakura is marked by に because
she is the target of that action, in this case very
literally.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Now, the に particle nearly always
marks a target of one kind or another.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So, if we are going somewhere or
sending something somewhere or putting something somewhere, we use
に for that "somewhere".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So if A is going to B, then B is
marked by に.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">B is the destination, the target of
that going.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So if I'm going to the park, I say
"公園に 行く".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">If I'm going to the shops, I say
"お店に 行く".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So the literal, physical destination
or target of movement is marked by に.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">However, we can also mark a subtler
kind of target.</span></p>
<h2 class="c22" id="h.k5s8i8cvx0s1"><span class="c16">に - Purpose
of an action</span></h2>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So we can say "お店に 卵を 買いに
行く".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">This means "I go to the shops to buy
eggs".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span style=
"overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 624.00px; height: 350.67px;">
<img alt="" src="images/image331.jpg" style=
"width: 624.00px; height: 350.67px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);"
title=""></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"お店" is "shops" – "shop" is 店 and we
put the honorific "お" on it because we give honor to the people who
help us to have all the lovely things that we are lucky enough to
have.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">" 卵" are eggs – you might, if you're
old enough, remember たまごっち, the little egg-person that you
raise.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And "買い" is the い-stem of "買う"– to
buy.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">The い-stem is a very special stem
and it can do lots of things, and it can also just be there on its
own.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"買いに 行く" means "[go] in order to
buy, for the purpose of buying".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Now, you may be saying, "I thought
that logical particles like に and が and を can only mark nouns"– and
that's absolutely correct.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Because one of the things that the
い-stem of a verb can do when it's on its own is turn that verb into
the equivalent noun. It can do something else as well, but I can
talk about that another day.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So "買い" , the act of buying, is a
noun.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Just as in English if we say "I like
swimming", "swimming" is a noun, swimming is a thing I like, and if
we say "I go to the shop for the purpose of buying eggs", then that
"buying" is also a noun, it's the thing we're going for.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And "買い" is just like
that.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So "買い" is the thing we're going to
do and it's a noun and it's marked by に.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So, you see that in this sentence we
have two targets: the shops – "お店"– is the actual physical target
of our going, the place, and buying eggs is the reason for our
going, so that's the emotional target, the volitional target, a
more subtle kind of target than the physical place we're going to,
but still a target.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And it's possible to have two
targets in the same sentence, both marked by に.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And that's exactly what we're doing
here.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So に gives us the target of an
action in the most literal sense and also the volitional target,
the actual aim of our action.</span></p>
<h2 class="c22" id="h.8onhhssk8m3u"><span class="c16">に -
Location</span></h2>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Now, to get back to more concrete
things, に which marks the actual location target of where we're
going, of where we're putting something, can also mark the place
where a person or a thing IS.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So I can say, "お店に 行く" – "I am going
to the shops / I will go to the shops"– and we can say, "お店に いる" –
"I am at the shops".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"公園に 行く" – "I'll go to the park" ;
"公園に いる" - "I'm at the park".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span style=
"overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 624.00px; height: 350.67px;">
<img alt="" src="images/image338.jpg" style=
"width: 624.00px; height: 350.67px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);"
title=""></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Now you see, this is also a target,
because in order for a thing to be anywhere, it must have gotten
there at some point.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So "に" can mark not only a future
target, a place where I will go to, it can also mark a past target,
a place where I went and where I still am.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And we also use this for inanimate
objects: "本は &nbsp;テーブル の 上に ある" – "the book is on the
table".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span style=
"overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 624.00px; height: 350.67px;">
<img alt="" src="images/image100.jpg" style=
"width: 624.00px; height: 350.67px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);"
title=""></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"上" is a noun, and in this case it
means the "on" of the table.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"上" can mean "up" or "over", in this
case it means "on", and it's always a noun, so in this case the "on
of the table" is the place where the book is: the past target of
the book, to which it went and at which it now remains.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So に can also mark the place where a
thing is, its past target.</span></p>
<h2 class="c22" id="h.ov2kcx2go4hf"><span class="c16">に -
Transformation</span></h2>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And the last aspect of "に" that I
want to look at is that に can also mark the target of a
transformation.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Just as if A is going to B, に marks
B, the place where it's going, if A turns into B, becomes B, then に
also marks B, the thing it's becoming, the thing it turns
into.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So if I say, "Sakuraは かえるに なった"...
("kaeru" is "frog" and "なる" is a close cousin of "ある": "ある" means
"be" ; "なる" means "become").</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span style=
"overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 624.00px; height: 350.67px;">
<img alt="" src="images/image135.jpg" style=
"width: 624.00px; height: 350.67px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);"
title=""></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So, "Sakuraは かえるに なった" – "Sakura
became a frog / Sakura turned into a frog", and に marks the thing
she became, the thing she turned into.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Now, you may be thinking, "Mmm, how
often do people turn into frogs these days?"– and I'll grant that
it isn't very often.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">However, this is a very important
thing to learn because there are various more everyday things that
turn into other things and also we use this form of expression much
more in Japanese than we do in English.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">For example, "今年 十八さいに なる": "今年"is
"this year", "十八さいに" is "18 years of age".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So we're saying, "this year I become
18".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span style=
"overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 624.00px; height: 350.67px;">
<img alt="" src="images/image287.jpg" style=
"width: 624.00px; height: 350.67px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);"
title=""></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Now in English we'd say that a
little differently: we might say, "I turn 18"or "I'll be 18", but
in Japanese we say "I will become 18 years of age".</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And if the day's going to get
cloudy, we might say "後で 曇りに なる" ("曇り" is "cloudy" ; "雲" is a
cloud, "曇り" is the state of being cloudy, and both of them are
nouns).</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span style=
"overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 624.00px; height: 350.67px;">
<img alt="" src="images/image92.jpg" style=
"width: 624.00px; height: 350.67px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);"
title=""></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">We say, "曇りに なる" which means "become
cloudy".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">In English we could say
that.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">We might be more likely to say "get
cloudy"or something, but in Japanese we use this "become " – "に
なる"– form of speech a lot of the time.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So it's an important thing to
learn.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And I should just add here than in
the case of an adjective it works slightly differently.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So if we want to say "Sakura is
beautiful", we say "さくらが 美しい" ("美しい" means "is-beautiful"), but if
we want to say "Sakura became beautiful", we can't use に because
"美しい" isn't a noun.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">It isn't a carriage, it's an engine,
isn't it? So what do we do? What we do is what we discussed last
week: we turn that adjective into its stem.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So we take off the い (-i) and add
く(く).</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And that's all we need to
do.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">That's how we use it: "さくらが 美しく なった"
– "Sakura became beautiful".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span style=
"overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 624.00px; height: 350.67px;">
<img alt="" src="images/image139.jpg" style=
"width: 624.00px; height: 350.67px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);"
title=""></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"なった" is the past of "なる" because
"なる" is a godan verb (it has to be a godan verb because it doesn't
end in -いる or える, it ends in -ある)</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So now we know some ways of
expressing subtler concepts like intention, purpose, transformation
– and we have leveled up.</span></p>
<h2 class="c22" id="h.ircmfyijeuxa"><span class="c16">へ -
Destination</span></h2>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Before we finish, I'm just going to
give you one more carriage that we haven't seen before, and that's
the he-car.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And this is very, very
simple.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">The particle " he"– as you see, this
is the kana へ, but when we use it as a particle we just pronounce
it e.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And it's a very simple
particle.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">It's a one-trick pony.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And it duplicates one, and only one,
of the uses of "に".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So when we say where we're going -
"a is going to B"– we mark B with に.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">We can also mark it with
-he.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And that's the only thing -he
does.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">As I say, it's a one-trick
pony.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">It can't even mark the place where
something has gone to and still is.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">It only ever marks the place a thing
is going to.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">" he" is very simple and it's good
to have another particle, another carriage, added to your arsenal,
isn't it?</span></p>

9: How textbooks DESTROY your Japanese: No 1 Secret! + Expressing

<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">こんにちは.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Today we are going to talk about the
Number One Secret of Japanese.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">This is the secret that will make
the difference between trying to understand Japanese as a vague,
fuzzy, magical language in which every sentence is a kind of
guessing game and having a solid, clear, logical grasp on the
language and its structure, so that you know in every sentence
exactly what's going on.</span></p>
<h2 class="c22" id="h.ddd8ccsmw3xg"><span class="c16">Changing
perspective</span></h2>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Now, this secret is something that
the schools and textbooks don't teach you.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">But they do more than just not teach
you, they do everything possible to prevent you from guessing it
for yourself.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Now, why would they do that? I'm not
talking about some kind of conspiracy here.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">I'm talking about the fact that the
way of describing and constructing the language is fundamentally
flawed.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Why is it flawed? Well, I think
we're really getting into an area here that goes beyond
grammar.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">It's an almost philosophical
question.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Japanese and English have very
different world-outlooks.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">In some ways they are diametrically
opposed.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">English is a very ego-centric
language.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And this isn't some kind of a moral
statement: I'm talking about grammar.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">English wants to have an "ego" as
the main actor, the center of every sentence, if it possibly
can.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Preferably "me", if not "me" then
someone else, and if not a person then at least an
animal.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">It has to be some kind of "ego"
actor.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Japanese doesn't work like that at
all.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">It's very happy to have non-sentient
beings as the main actor of a sentence.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">You might call this a more animist
way of looking at language.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Now, this may sound rather abstract,
but it's not abstract at all.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Let's get into some concrete
examples.</span></p>
<h2 class="c22" id="h.jx2flhaw9xsj"><span class="c16">好き -
Pleasing</span></h2>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">I'm going to begin with my favorite
example, and if you've heard it before, don't go away because we're
going much deeper this time.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">My favorite example is: "私は コーヒーが
好きだ."</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span style=

title=""></span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Now, we have have the "私" or we can
not have it; it will be understood whether we say it or
not.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">What the textbooks and the schools
and everybody else tells you is that this means "I like
coffee".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And "I like coffee" may well be what
we would say in English if we wanted to say something similar, but
it's not what this sentence means.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And if you've followed the course up
to this point, you can see why it isn't.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">The first and most important point
here is – look where the が is.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">The が is marking the
coffee.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">We know that the main actor, the
doer or the be-er of a sentence, is always marked by が, so we know
that the main actor of this sentence is not "私"–"I", it is the
coffee, which is marked by が.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"私" could have an invisible が after
it, but in this case it can't, because we already know what the が
is, it's the coffee.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So the coffee is being or doing
something.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">In English we are told that it is an
"A does B" sentence, but we only have to look at it to see that it
isn't.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">It ends with "だ" – it's an "A is B"
sentence, isn't it? The coffee is "好き".</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So, what does "好き" mean? 好き is a
noun, and it's one of those adjectival nouns that we've talked
about before.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So it's telling us something about
the nature or condition of the coffee.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">In this case, what it's telling us
is that the coffee is pleasing. That's the core of the sentence:
"Coffee is pleasing."</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">The "私は", implicit or explicit, is
telling us in whose case it is pleasing: "as for me, coffee is
pleasing." Now, this is very very very important.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Because if we don't know that, if we
really believe that this sentence means "I like coffee", our grasp
of が and を is completely messed up.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">If the actor of this sentence was
"私", it would have to be marked by が.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">If the thing that the actor was
acting upon, by liking it, was the coffee, then it would have to be
marked by を.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So we have two particles, and two
most fundamental particles, completely confused in our
mind.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">We now believe that sometimes が can
mark the object of the sentence instead of the subject, the thing
acted upon instead of the be-er or doer of the sentence.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And we now believe that the object
of the sentence, the thing being acted on, can sometimes be marked
by が instead of を.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And none of this is true.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">It never can. That can never
happen.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span>And if that could happen, Japanese would
become</span> <span>chaos</span><span class="c1">.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And that's exactly what it does
become in the minds of many students.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So, as we see in this sentence, "私"
is the non-logical topic of the sentence.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">It's marked by は.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">It's not the actor.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">It's not the subject.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"コーヒー" is not the object, which
would be marked by を if it was.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">“It” is the subject.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And "好き" is not a verb meaning "to
like"; it's an adjective meaning "to be pleasing".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So every single word in this
sentence is being misdescribed by the standard
explanation.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And this kind of misunderstanding
throws Japanese into complete chaos.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Now, are there many cases like this
in Japanese? Well, frankly, it doesn't matter if there are many or
not.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Once your understanding of the
particles is messed up, it's messed up.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">But as it happens there are a
lot.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">All kinds of different sentence
structures in Japanese throw up this same
misunderstanding.</span></p>
<h2 class="c22" id="h.fq9pqy8cux95"><span class="c16">分かる -
Clear</span></h2>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">For example, if we say "本が 分かる", or
"私は 本が 分かる", we're saying the book is understandable, but the
English texts tell you that this means "I understand the book", and
in this case it's even less forgivable, because there isn't really
an equivalent to "好き" in English, but there is an equivalent to
"分かる". It means "understandable" or "clear".</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span style=
"overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 624.00px; height: 350.67px;">

title=""></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">We could say "In relation to me, or
just to me, the book is understandable", and then we wouldn't be
completely messing up what が does or thinking that a noun that
should be marked by を can be marked by が, at random.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So why, at least in this case, don't
the schools and textbooks simply translate it as it really is? "to
me, the book is understandable / Speaking of me, the book is
understandable." because this prejudice for putting an ego at the
center of every sentence is so strong that it takes precedence over
learning Japanese correctly.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And these are not just a few random
cases.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Later on, we're going to look at the
potential form and we're going to look at the receptive form, which
is misdescribed as passive, and both of them are going to throw up
forms of this same problem.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Since they are both fairly large
subjects in themselves, I'm not going to talk about them
now.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">But let's talk about the way we
desire things in Japanese.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Let's talk about how Japanese
handles desire.</span></p>
<h2 class="c22" id="h.kblqno91mwno"><span class="c16">ほしい - Is
wanted</span></h2>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Whether we want something or want to
do something, how do we talk about this in Japanese? Well, suppose
we want something.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Let's say "子猫が ほしい".</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span style=
"overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 624.00px; height: 350.67px;">
<img alt="" src="images/image320.jpg" style=

title=""></span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"子猫" is a kitten: "子" is child or
small thing and "猫" is cat.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And "ほしい" is translated in English
as "want".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Now, if you look at it, the first
thing you can see is that it's not a verb.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">It's an adjective.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">It ends in "i", not in
"u".</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And the second thing you can see,
which is the most important, is that the が marked actor of this
sentence is not me, who wants the cat.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">It's the cat, who is
wanted.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span>So</span><span>, what</span><span class=
"c1">&nbsp;does "ほしい" mean? Well, quite simply, it means "is
wanted".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"In relation to me, the cat is
wanted." and again, if we seriously believe that this means "I want
a cat", we're thinking that the が can mark the object of a
sentence, the object of the action, the thing we're doing it
to.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So again, we're being confused about
the role が plays in a sentence, we're confused about the role を
plays in a sentence, because the cat should be marked by を if it
meant "I want a cat".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And we're confused between the verbs
and adjectives.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So again Japanese becomes a strange
guessing game in which particles and kinds of word can change their
meaning at random.</span></p>
<h2 class="c22" id="h.ud9v68p9c6fi"><span class="c16">たい - Want to
[Verb]</span></h2>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Now, suppose we want to do
something.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">In Japanese we express wanting to do
something differently from the way we express wanting to have
something.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And the way we do it is by using the
い-stem again.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span style=
"overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 624.00px; height: 350.67px;">
<img alt="" src="images/image357.jpg" style=

title=""></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">The い-stem, as I told you before, is
a very important stem.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So in order to say we want something
we have to add the want-adjective, which is "たい".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So we now have an
adjective.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And what does this adjective mean?
It doesn't mean "want" in the English sense.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">It can't, because "want" is a verb
and "たい" , ending in "i", is an adjective, isn't it?</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So let's take an example.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">This is a slightly notorious
example.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"クレープが 食べたい".</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span style=
"overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 624.00px; height: 350.67px;">

title=""></span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Now, the standard English
translation of this is "I want to eat crepes".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">But, as you see, the pattern here is
just the same as in the other cases we've been
considering.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">The が marked actor is not "私", it's
not "me", it's the crepes.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">The desirability of the crepes is
not a verb, it's an adjective.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And we need to understand this
because if we don't it's not just going to mess up this kind of
sentence – it's going to mess up our whole grasp of Japanese words,
Japanese particles and Japanese structure.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Now, there's no really good way of
translating this into English.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">We would have to say something like
"In relation to me, crepes are desire-inducing".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And that's very awkward.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And sometimes people ask me, "am I
really supposed to use all these awkward literal translations that
you give, rather than using natural English?" and the answer to
that is, no.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">You're not supposed to be thinking
in terms of my awkward explanations or thinking in terms of natural
English.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">You're supposed to be thinking of
Japanese in terms of – guess what – Japanese.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">I'm explaining it in English to give
you a start toward doing that.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">But these unnatural translations or
explanations are there to help you grasp the structure of Japanese,
not to give you a way of translating Japanese.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Now, as I say, the pattern is the
same in all these cases, and I don't think it's very difficult to
grasp.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">It may take you a little while to
adjust your mind to the more "animist" way of thinking, and to do
that you may want to watch this video two or three times more to
get it fixed in your head, but it isn't inherently difficult, I
think you will agree.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">But now we're going to look at
something which could seems a little confusing, and I promise you
it isn't, if you just follow carefully what I'm going to
say.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">We have this sentence here: "クレープが
食べたい" but what if we didn't have the crepes here?</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">What if we just said "食べたい"
?</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Now there's no longer in this
sentence what English wants to call the object of desire, what is
in fact the subject of desire, the desire-inducer, and obviously
there has to be a が marked zero-car or, as you know, we don't have
a sentence.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">But what is that zero-car in this
case? Well, the ironic thing is that in this case the zero-car is
what the English textbooks thought it was all along.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">It's "I".</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span style=
"overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 624.00px; height: 350.67px;">

title=""></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">I really am the actor of the
sentence this time, and that may be part of the reason for a lot of
the confusion that happens on this subject.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"私が 食べたい" means "I want to eat"– I
don't want to eat crepes necessarily or Sakura's obento
necessarily, I just want to eat.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And because there is no eat-inducing
subject here, the want to-eat is attributed directly to
me.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And you may be asking – you should
be asking – "So, what is this たい?</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Is it an adjective describing the
condition of something making you want to do something, or is it an
adjective describing my desire?" and the answer is that it can be
either.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Obviously when it is describing a
cake it's also indirectly describing my feelings about the cake,
it's describing the feelings the cake induces in me.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And when there's no cake there, or
no crepe here, or no Sakura's obento there, we just describe my
feelings directly.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And this is often the case in
Japanese with adjectives of desire.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">For example, "怖い" , which means
either "scared" or "scary".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">If I say, "お化けが 怖い" , I'm saying,
"Ghosts are scary", but if I say just "怖い" , I'm saying, "I am
scared".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span style=
"overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 624.00px; height: 350.67px;">

title=""></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Now, is this confusing? It isn't
confusing because we have a landmark that tells us what to do every
time.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And that landmark is が.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">In these sentences and in much much
more complicated sentences, if we watch the が and watch the other
logical particles, we'll never go wrong, because the logical
particles never ever ever change their function.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So we can use them as our
compass.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And that's why it's so very
destructive to induce people to believe they can change their
function as the textbooks do.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">If you have a compass and I say to
you, "ah, well, most of the time the compass points north, but
sometimes points south and actually quite a lot of the time it also
points east", you might as well not have a compass.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">I have destroyed the value of your
compass for you.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And it's the same with the logical
particles.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">They are absolutely
reliable.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">They always point north.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">They never change their
function.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So, if が marks the crepes then we
know that the subject of the sentence, the thing about which the
engine is telling us, is the crepes, nothing else.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">But if we don't have the が marked
subject there, we know that by default the zero-pronoun is usually
"I" unless there's a reason to think it's something
else.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">It's just the same as in the eel
example that we gave in the lesson on は .</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Now, I'm going to tell you one more
thing, and I hope I'm not overloading you with information in this
lesson, but it will have the advantage of giving you even more
confidence about what the zero pronoun is in these
cases.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And that is that you cannot use
these adjectives of desire, of feeling, about anyone but
yourself.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So if I say "食べたい" and there is
nothing to 食べたい in the sentence or the context then I must be
talking about me, I can't be talking about you and I can't be
talking about Sakura.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Why not? Because Japanese doesn't
permit us to do that.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">You can't use "たい" about someone
else, or "怖い" or "ほしい" – we can't use any of these things about
someone else.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">What if we want to say that someone
else wants something? Well, because Japanese is a very logical
language, it does not allow us to make definite statements about
something we can't know for sure, so you see it's very different
from Western languages.</span></p>

<p class="c0"><span class="c1">One thing we can't know for sure is
someone else's inner feelings.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So I might think that Sakura wants
to eat cake, but I don't know that.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">All I know is how she's acting, I
know what she says, I know what she does, I know how she looks, but
I don't know what her inner feelings are.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So if I want to talk about her
desire to eat cake, I can't use "たい".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And I can't use "怖い" to describe her
fear, and I can't use "ほしい" to describe a thing she might
want.</span></p>
<h2 class="c22" id="h.4g2rrewo9lvm"><span class="c16">がる - To show
signs of …</span></h2>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So what do I do? I have to add to
the adjective of desire a helper verb.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">I take the "い" off the い-Adjective
and I add the helper verb "がる".</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span style=
"overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 624.00px; height: 350.67px;">

title=""></span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And "がる" means "to show signs of /
to look as if it is the case".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So if I say, "さくらが &nbsp;ケーキを ほしがる"
then I'm saying Sakura is showing signs of wanting cake.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span style=
"overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 624.00px; height: 350.67px;">

title=""></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">That's what I'm literally
saying.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And even if she's actually told me
she wants cake, that's still what I say, because I can't feel her
feelings.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">I only know what she's doing and
saying.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Now, why do we use a verb in the
case of other people when it's an adjective in the case of
ourselves? Again, this is very logical.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">I can't describe someone else's
feelings because I can't feel them.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">I don't know about them.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">I can only speak of their actions,
and their actions obviously must be a verb.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So this is a useful thing to know,
but it also helps us to be very clear when we say "食べたい" or
anything else たい, or anything "ほしい" , that if there is not a cause
of that emotion, then the zero pronoun must be me, "私", because it
can't be anybody else.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">We actually can't use it for anybody
else.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span>So that's quite a lot of information in one
lesson, but understanding this is going to short-cut you right
through a huge area of confusion and misunderstanding that troubles
many Japanese learners for years.</span></p>

Lesson 10: "Japanese conjugation" myth busted! Also, potential verb
form secret unlocked</a></span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">こんにちは.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Today we're going to talk about the
main helper-verbs and about the potential form.</span></p>
<h2 class="c22" id="h.po5fkbyniw8a"><span class="c16">Main Helper
Verbs</span></h2>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">When I say "the main helper-verbs",
I'm referring to what the standard Western Japanese grammar
descriptions call "conjugation".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And I only mention this word because
I don't want you to get confused if you see "conjugation" referred
to somewhere else.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">When they talk about "conjugation",
this is what they mean.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">But in fact there is no such thing
as conjugation in Japanese.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">All we ever do is add helper words
to the four verb stems.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And there are a lot of helper words
and most of them are just a question of extra vocabulary so long as
you don't think of them as conjugation.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">In some cases they get called
"conjugation", in other cases they don't, and they're exactly the
same process every time.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">The only difference is that some of
them happen to accidentally, and only very vaguely, resemble
European conjugation and others don't.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">All kinds of confusions arise from
confusing Japanese helper-verbs and helper-adjectives with
conjugations, but because we're not going to use them, we don't
need to worry about that here.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">All right.</span></p>
<h2 class="c22" id="h.182g6z7sqwgg"><span class="c16">Potential
form conjugation</span></h2>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So, the first main helper-verb we're
going to look at is the potential verb.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Now, we've already looked, haven't
we, at helper words.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">We've looked at the
helper-adjectives "ない" , which forms the negative, and "たい" , which
is used for the desirability of an action.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">We've also looked at the helper-verb
"がる", which is attached to an adjective.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Now we're going to look at the
potential helper-verb, and this attaches to the e-stem.</span></p>
<p class="c19 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">There aren't as many things we do
with the e-stem as we do with the a- and い-stems, but there are
some.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And only one of them is a verb, so
there's no room for confusion here.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">The potential helper-verb has two
forms, and they are "る" and "られる".</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span style=
"overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 624.00px; height: 350.67px;">
<img alt="" src="images/image196.jpg" style=
"width: 624.00px; height: 350.67px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);"
title=""></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">People can be a little disconcerted
by the godan form of the helper-verb because it's just one
character, る (ru).</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">But that shouldn't worry you at all,
and because it only ever goes onto the e-stem, can't be used on its
own, it's very very easy to recognize.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"られる" is the form of the potential
helper-verb that goes onto ichidan verbs – and we discussed godan
and ichidan verbs before, didn't we?</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So,</span></p>
<ul class="c13 lst-kix_yaxysrb3r5r-0 start">
<li class="c17 c30 li-bullet-0"><span class="c1">"買う" (buy) becomes
"買える "(buy-able);</span></li>
<li class="c17 c30 li-bullet-0"><span class="c1">"聞く" (hear)
becomes "聞ける" (hear-able);</span></li>
<li class="c17 c30 li-bullet-0"><span class="c1">"話す" (speak)
becomes "話せる" (speak-able);</span></li>
<li class="c17 c30 li-bullet-0"><span class="c1">"持つ" (hold)
becomes "持てる" (hold-able) and so forth.</span></li>
</ul>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And with "食べる", which is an ichidan
verb, we do what we always do, simply take off the る and put on
whatever we're going to put on.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So "食べる" (eat) becomes "食べられる"
(eat-able).</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So this is very simple, isn't it?
There are only two exceptions to this formation of the potential
form and they are the two Japanese irregular verbs, "来る" and
"する".</span></p>
<ul class="c13 lst-kix_t292t1supn8b-0 start">
<li class="c17 c30 li-bullet-0"><span class="c1">"来る" become
"来られる", but</span></li>
<li class="c17 c30 li-bullet-0"><span class="c1">"する" surprisingly
becomes "出来る".</span></li>
</ul>
<h2 class="c22" id="h.op0czk68gyta"><span class="c16">出来る
(できる)</span></h2>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"出来る" is the potential form of
"する".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And this is an interesting word
because it also means "come out"– literally it's made up of the
kanji "out" (出) and "come" (来) – "できる" (出来る).</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And if we say "日本語が 出来る", we're not
saying "I can do Japanese", we're saying "Japanese is
possible".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And if we say or imply "私は 日本語が
出来る", we're saying, "to me, Japanese is possible".</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And it's interesting if you see a
small child perhaps trying to make something out of paper, she may
say, "I'm trying very hard, but it won't come out right"– and this
is just the way "出来る" is used in Japanese, isn't it? And there are
some interesting ways in which "出来る" is used which show how the
idea of something being possible and something coming out are
closely linked in the Japanese language.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">But we won't talk about that now –
that's a little bit more advanced.</span></p>
<h2 class="c22" id="h.wlfket85vs5n"><span class="c16">が + Potential
Form</span></h2>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">There's only one danger area with
the potential form, and it's very very close to something we dealt
with last week.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So if you've seen that lesson, this
one should be very easy to you.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Let's look at a typical sentence:
"本が 読める."</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Now, the standard texts usually
translate this as "I can read the book".</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span style=
"overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 624.00px; height: 350.67px;">
<img alt="" src="images/image113.jpg" style=
"width: 624.00px; height: 350.67px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);"
title=""></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">But that isn't what it means, as you
can clearly understand if you followed our previous
lesson.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Look where the が is.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">The が is marking what? It's marking
the book! So who is the actor of this sentence? It's the
book.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">We are saying something about the
book.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So the book is the main car and
"読める" is the engine.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">We are saying the book is readable,
it's possible to read the book.</span></p>
<p class="c19 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">If we add "私は ", we are saying the
book is readable "to me".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">What we are literally saying is, "In
relation to me, the book is readable".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">But this does not and cannot mean,
"I can read the book".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">If we wanted to say "I can read the
book", the book would have to be marked by を, wouldn't it? And I
would have to be marked by が.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And it is in fact possible to do
this, but it's not what is usually done.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">But also remember that if we want to
put stress on the ego, the way English wants to, then we have to
change the particles.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">If we literally want to say, "I can
read the book" – "私が 本を 読める".</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span style=
"overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 624.00px; height: 350.67px;">
<img alt="" src="images/image237.jpg" style=
"width: 624.00px; height: 350.67px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);"
title=""></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">A lot of people think this is bad
Japanese.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Not our place to work out whether it
is or isn't bad Japanese.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">The point is that most of the time
you will see "本が 読める", and "本が 読める" can't literally mean "I can
read the book".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">It means "the book is
readable".</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So that's simple enough, and
provided we remember that, we don't send all those particles into
crazy illogicality.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So really this is very much similar
to the questions we discussed last week about たい and adjectives of
desire.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">If we just keep that が straight in
our minds, everything else will fall into place.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And just as with the たい-form if we
say, "ケーキが 食べたい" , it's the cake that being want-inducing, but if
we just say "食べたい" we do mean "I want to eat", because when there's
no particular food there to do the being wanted, then I do the
wanting.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">It's the same with the potential
form.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So we say, "本が 読める" – "to me the
book is read-able", but if we just want to say "I can read"– not "I
can read the book or I can read the newspaper or I can read
Sakura's secret diary", but "I can read"– then we say "私が 読める"or
just "読める", which means "zeroが 読める".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And we really have become the
subject of the sentence.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span style=
"overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 624.00px; height: 350.67px;">
<img alt="" src="images/image164.jpg" style=

title=""></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And I am sure there are people who
find this confusing, but if you followed the past lesson this
should be completely clear.</span></p>
<h2 class="c22" id="h.uw46z5f7j9ag"><span class="c16">Conjugate
る</span></h2>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And let's remember that Japanese
always fits together just like Lego, so the potential helper-verb,
even when it's just that single kana る (ru), is simply a regular
ichidan verb like most helper-verbs, and we can do exactly the same
things with it that we can do with other helper-verbs.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">We'll always recognize it, because
it's the only one that goes onto the e-stem, and we can do
everything with it that we do with any other ichidan
verb.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So: "歩ける"– can walk; "歩けない" – can't
walk; "歩けた"– could walk; "歩けなかった"– couldn't walk.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span style=
"overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 624.00px; height: 350.67px;">

title=""></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And this regularity is the same even
with the irregulars.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So: "出来る"– possible; "出来ない" – not
possible; "出来た"– was possible; "出来なかった"– wasn't
possible.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And it's really as easy as
that.</span></p>

<p class="c0"><span class="c1">こんにちは.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">We've now completed ten lessons and
it's time for a change of pace.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">We've learned enough now that we can
start looking at some real narrative.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">It'll be a little simplified at
first, but we can use this to bring together the things we've
learned so far.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">We'll also be learning new
structural elements because even in the simplest story we're going
to encounter things that we need to learn.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">But I think this may be a more
interesting way of doing it.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So please let me know what you think
in the comments below.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">All right.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Now let's go into a story that I
believe we all know.</span></p>
<h2 class="c22" id="h.uc4kcdn9t4y1"><span class=
"c16">ある</span></h2>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"ある 日 アリスは 川の そばに いた."</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Now, this is a simple
sentence.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span style=
"overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 624.00px; height: 350.67px;">

title=""></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">The word "川" means "river", and "そば"
means "beside" and it's a noun.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So "川のそば" is "the beside of the
river".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Just as we put something on the "on"
of the table or the "under" of the table and we also always mark it
with に, so the "beside of the river" is where Alice was.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"ある" means "a certain", so "ある 日" is
like "one day" or "a certain day", and let's notice that what's
happening here is what we've seen before.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"ある" is the verb that means "exist"
or "be", and what we've done here is what we've seen in the video
lesson on so-called adjectives.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">We can make any engine into an
adjective.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So, "ある" is an "A does B" engine, an
う-engine, so if we say "本が ある" we are saying, "there is a book / a
book exists".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And if we move that "ある" engine to
the other side of the book, we turn it white and it becomes a
descriptor, an adjectival.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So we're saying "ある 本" – "an
existing book / a certain book / a book that there is".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And it's the same: "ある 日" – "a
certain day".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"ある 日 アリスは 川の そばに いた"</span></p>

<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So we've got quite a complex
sentence here, and let's break it down.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"お姉ちゃん" means "big sister": "nee" is
"sister" ; "-chan", I'm sure you know, is a cute, friendly
honorific; "o-"is also an honorific.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So, "お姉ちゃん" – "big
sister".</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"つまらない" means "dull" or
"boring".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"本", as we know, is
"book".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Yomu" means "read" ; "呼んで いる"– we
put the "読む" into the て-form and add "いる" and it means "is
reading"; and then we put the "いる" itself into the
て-form.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So why are we doing all that? Let's
take a look.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"お姉ちゃんは つまらない本を 呼んでいて" – "big sister
is reading a boring book"– but then that て....</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">て-form has a lot of different
uses.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">In this case it will complete a
clause.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"big sister is reading a boring
book"– that's a complete clause, isn't it? And if we turn that
final u-engine into the て-form, what we're saying is that something
else is going to follow this clause.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">We are indicating that we're making
a complex sentence made up of more than one clause.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So it's like saying, "big sister was
reading a boring book and..." and that something else comes: "遊んで
くれなかった".</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"遊ぶ" means to "play", and that also
is in the て-form, isn't it? "遊ぶ"--&gt; 遊んで ".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">If you're in any doubt of how we
make these て-forms, please go back to the video lesson on the
て-form and refresh your memory.</span></p>
<h2 class="c22" id="h.rlk3phh7i3eu"><span class="c16">てあげる /
てくれる</span></h2>

title=""></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"遊んで くれなかった."</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Now this is another use of the
て-form. て-form is terribly important and it does various different
things.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">What's it doing here? Well, "遊ぶ", as
we know, means "play".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"くれる" means to "give", and it
specifically means "give downwards".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span style=
"overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 624.00px; height: 350.67px;">

title=""></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And the reason we say "give
downwards" in Japanese is because we are always polite to
people.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So we always represent ourselves as
being below other people and other people as being above
ourselves.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So if I say "くれる" (give), I always
mean that someone is giving something to me or to someone close to
me.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">But what is Alice's big sister
giving – or not giving – to Alice? Well, it's not the
book.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">In fact, it's not any actual
object.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">She is giving the action to which
"くれる" is connected by the て-form.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">She is giving – or in this case, not
giving – the act of playing to Alice.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">What do we mean by that? Well, we
say "くれる" not only for giving a thing – a book, a present, a candy
– we also say it for giving an action, for doing something for our
benefit.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">This is very very often used in
Japanese, so it's important to understand it.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">If someone does something for our
benefit, we turn that action to て-form and we add "くれる".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">If we do something for someone
else's benefit, we turn that action into て-form and add "あげる",
which means to "give upward", in other words, to give to you, to
give to another person.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span>"くれる" and "あげる"– give down to me or my group /
[" あげる"] give up to you or someone else or your group or their
group.</span><span style=

<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So what is this second part of the
sentence?</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">It's "遊んで くれなかった" – "she didn't
play/ she didn't give Alice playing-with / she didn't play for
Alice's benefit".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">It's rather different from anything
we find in English, but I think it's also very expressive,
something we could actually do with having in English.</span></p>

<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Notice that we have two complete
clauses here:</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"お姉ちゃんは つまらない本を 呼んだ"– that's a
complete clause in itself, isn't it?</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"お姉ちゃんは 遊んで くれなかった" – "お姉ちゃん did not
play for Alice's benefit" and we've connected the two together with
the て-form.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">A thing we should notice here is
that "お姉ちゃんは つまらない本を 呼んで" doesn't tell us the tense.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">We don't know whether she's reading
a boring book right now or in the future or in the past.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">We don't know that until we get to
the end of the sentence.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">In English we put the tense marker
on both halves of a complex sentence.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">We would say, "big sister WAS
reading a boring book..." so we already know that it's in the
past.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">But in Japanese we put that tense
marker, た or かった, at the end and we only need one tense marker per
sentence.</span></p>

<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"呼んで いて" could mean "is reading"or

<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And in Japanese we have two common

usual sense: a physical thing – a hat, a book, a pair of glasses,
Mount Fuji.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"こと" is a more abstract kind of
"thing": an affair, a matter, a circumstance.</span></p>

<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So, when we say, "Is there any thing

<p class="c0"><span class="c1">But the important thing to notice
here is that little particle "と".</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">There are actually two "と"
particles: one means "and" and it's very simple; the other one is
what we call the "quotation particle", and that's what we're
dealing with here.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">When we quote someone as saying
something or even as thinking something, we use this particle と

<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">As you see, we use the square
quotation marks in Japanese, which are the equivalent to English
quotation marks, but we also use the と.</span></p>

interesting is happening,' Alice said".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">We say, "'Nothing interesting is

"just then / at that moment / at that time".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So we use just the way we use other
relative time expressions: we don't need to put に or anything else

<p class="c0"><span class="c1">In this particular sentence, the
point of "その時" is that just at that moment when Alice had been

<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"その時、 白いうさぎが 通りすぎた."</span></p>

<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Now, 普通 means "ordinary", and the
rest of this you already know.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"ではない" means "it isn't / it wasn't"
and we're putting into the て-form because this is part of a complex
sentence – and we looked at complex sentences last week, didn't
we?</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So, "普通 の うさぎ ではなくって" – "It was not
an ordinary rabbit."</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"...チョッキを 着ている うさぎ だった."</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"チョッキ" means a vest.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"着る” means "wear", so "着ている" means
to "be wearing /be in the act of wearing".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And "だった", of course, is the past
tense of the copula.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So this is: "It was not an ordinary
rabbit, it was a wearing-a-vest rabbit /it was a rabbit that was
wearing a vest."</span></p>

<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"懐中時計" is not a word we're going to
encounter all that often because there aren't many of them around
these days, but it is an example of something we're going to see an
awful lot, which is that in Japanese, as you know, we can modify
one noun with another by marking the first one with の (or な, which
is a form of だ) but we can also, when we're not just modifying one
noun with another but forming a new noun, we can simply ram them
together.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">We don't have to modify them in any
way, the way we do with verbs – we turn them into the い-stem, but
you can't do that with nouns, nouns don't have any stems, they
don't modify in any way – so, when you're putting two nouns
together to make a new noun, you simply push them into each
other.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">This is the same as what we do in
English, with words like seaweed or bookshelf.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">We just push two nouns together to
make a new noun.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So the parts of this noun, "懐中時計":
懐中 is a slightly unusual noun – it means "in one's pocket or the
inside of one's pocket" and 時計 is a very common word – it means
"clock or watch" (we have the same word for a clock in Japanese
whether it's a small one or a big one), so "懐中時計" is a pocket
watch.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And the reason we say "-dokei"
instead of "tokei" is what Alice in "Alice in Kanji Land"calls
"tenten hooking", and this is that when you push two nouns
together, in the way that we are doing here, and the second one
begins with a sharp sound like "t" or "k", we turn it into its
equivalent dull sound like "d" or "b".</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span style=
"overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 624.00px; height: 350.67px;">

title=""></span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And of course in Japanese you do
this by adding those two small marks to the kana, so と becomes ど, た
becomes だ , く becomes ぐ, さ becomes ざ etc.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So, for example, "ao" is blue, as
you know, "sora" is "sky" and when you put them together you get
not "aosora" but "aozora".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">We put the 〃 onto that sharp word,
and Alice calls that "〃 hooking".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">It's as if those two little points,
those two little claws, hook into the word before it to turn them
into a single word.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">It's a thing you're going to see
very often.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And just as in English you can't do
this with any two nouns, but there are a lot of nouns that are made
up of two nouns and so long as one of the nouns isn't a slightly
unusual one like "懐中", they're very easy to understand, just as
they are in English.</span></p>
<h2 class="c22" id="h.mrrio8dqwl6p"><span class="c16">と - Quotation
Particle (2)</span></h2>
<p class="c0"><span style=
"overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 624.00px; height: 350.67px;">

title=""></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And then we have "...「遅い! 遅い!」と
言って".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Now, we're going to look at what
this と actually does, and as we get into more complex sentences,
three-level compound sentences like this one, we start to see how
useful it becomes.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">What と actually does structurally is
that it takes whatever it marks – and that could be two words like
this or it could be a whole paragraph with all kinds of other
grammar going on in it – it takes whatever it marks as a quotation
and turns it effectively into a single noun.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So a と-carriage is a white
noun-carriage marked with と .</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And we're going to find as we go on
that this is used not only to mark things people say and things
people think, but all kinds of other things.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And we'll have an example of that a
little later in this lesson.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">But this と-structure is essentially
making a quasi-noun out of whatever is marked with と , and the と
then makes it function as a modifier to the verb that
follows.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span style=
"overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 624.00px; height: 350.67px;">
<img alt="" src="images/image284.jpg" style=
"width: 624.00px; height: 350.67px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);"
title=""></span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">When it's a simple quotation like
that, the verb is going to be 言う (to say), but it could also be
"考える" (to think) or "思う" (to think or feel), but it can be many
other things too, as you're going to see in a moment.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So this is the structure of a
to-marked statement of any kind.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"...「遅い! 遅い!」 と 言って,
走り出した."</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">遅い means "late".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And in order to make it a sentence,
obviously we have to have a zero-pronoun here.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So the rabbit is either saying "It's
late!" or "I'm late!"</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">In the Disney version, of course, it
was "I'm late!"</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"遅い! 遅い！" – "I'm late! I'm
late!"</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">We don't need to say と with うさぎは 言って
this time because we've got うさぎは at the beginning of the sentence
and this is a compound sentence.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So the second part of the compound
sentence has the same main carriage, the same subject as the first
half.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"...「遅い! 遅い!」と 言って" – "the rabbit
said, “I'm late! I'm late!" and that 言って is another compound-言って,
so this time we have a three-deep compound sentence.</span></p>
<h2 class="c22" id="h.d3bg69iyxtg3"><span class="c16">出す -
Auxiliary Verb</span></h2>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">The rabbit looked at his watch, he
said "遅い! 遅い！", and then... he did something else:</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"走り出した".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"はしる" means "run" and "出す" literally
means to "take out", but this is a combination we're going to see
very often in Japanese.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Once again, we're using that い-stem
, which is the main connecting stem, to connect 走り to
出す.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And what does it mean here? Well,
that 出す when it's connected to a verb means that the action of the
verb "erupted".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So we can say that someone "泣き出した":
泣く is "cry", and we connect the い-stem of 泣く to 出す, and "泣き出す"
means "burst out crying".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">We can say "笑い出す": 笑う is "laugh" and
if we connect the い-stem of "笑う" to "出す", we're saying "burst out
laughing".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And in this case what happened? The
rabbit suddenly burst out running – it broke into a run.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"うさぎは 懐中時計を 見て,「遅い! 遅い!」と 言って,
走り出した."</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;"the rabbit looked at its
pocket watch, it cried 'I'm late! I'm late!' and it broke into
running."</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>

<p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;"「ちょっと 待って, ください!」と アリスは

title=""></span><span class="c1">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"ちょっと 待って、 ください" is a phrase you're
going to hear a lot in Japanese.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Sometimes the "ください" will get left
off.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">What does it mean?</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">ちょっと means "a little" ;</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">待って is the て-form of 待つ, which means
“to wait"; and ください means "please".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">It's actually connected with "くれる",
which we talked about last time; which also refers to giving down –
it's "please give down to me / please lower down to my level", so
that's a polite way of saying "please give".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">But it's not just giving a thing,
just as with "くれる" and "あげる", it's not just giving a thing, it can
also be, if you connect it to the て-form of a verb, giving the
action of that verb.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So you can see it's very related to
that "くれる" and "あげる" that we learned last week.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"ちょっと 待って、 ください！"</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Now, because this is so common, very
often when we put a verb into て-form and address it to someone,
it's kind of short for "てください".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"ちょっと 待って、 ください！" means "Please wait
a little".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So she's asking the rabbit to stop;
she wants to meet with the rabbit.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"「ちょっと 待って, ください!」 と アリスは
呼んだ."</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So we've got that と particle again,
the quotation particle, which we need when we quote anything, and
then "呼んだ".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"呼んだ": what does that mean? Well,
we've come across "呼んだ" before I think, haven't we? And it means
"read", "read" in the past.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">That is the た-form - the だ-form in
this case - of “読む".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">But in this case it's
different.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">It's the だ-form of "呼ぶ".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">If you remember from our て and
た-form lesson, the New Boom group of verbs, nu-, bu- and mu-ending
verbs, all form their て-form with -nde and their た-form with
-nda.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So both "読む" and "呼ぶ" have the past
form "よんだ".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Fortunately, we're not very often
likely to get reading and calling mixed up, are we? This "yobu"
means to "call", to "shout out".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">It can mean "call" in any of the
senses that "call" is used in English.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">You can call someone a name, you can
call an apple a lemon (but you'd be wrong) or you can call
out.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"「ちょっと 待って, ください!」 と アリスは
呼んだ."</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"'Please wait a minute!' called
Alice."</span></p>
<h2 class="c22" id="h.q73r04n42g3z"><span class="c16">Sound
words</span></h2>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"でも うさぎは ピョンピョンと 走り続けた."</span></p>

title=""></span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"でも" means "but".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"走る" means "run".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And we're going to leave out
"ピョンピョン" for just a moment here.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"続ける" means to
"continue".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So again we've got this form of
taking the い-stem of a verb, "走る" becomes "走り" and then we add onto
it the verb "続ける" (to continue).</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So "うさぎは 走り 続けた" means "the rabbit
continued running".</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"ピョンピョン" is something we're going to
find very often in Japanese and that is, a doubled word that is a
sound effect.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">There are lots and lots of these in
Japanese, [e.g.] "しくしく", which is the sound effect for
crying.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And some of them will be literal
sounds and some of them describe states of various
kinds.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So we're going to be meeting a lot
of these later.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"ピョンピョン" is almost a literal sound
effect.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">It's the sound of a small thing
jumping along, and you'll hear this an awful lot.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">I do at any rate, but then, a lot of
my friends are small things that jump along.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So ピョンピョン" is the sound, or not
quite a sound, it's... if it were an anime you'd probably hear the
sound, wouldn't you, pyon-pyon-pyon-pyon-pyon – but in this case
it's not necessarily a sound you hear, but it's the feeling, the
sound-like feeling of a small thing, a small animal, jumping,
jumping, little jumps.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So, because it's a rabbit, it didn't
run the way you run, it runs in a little jumping, bouncing fashion
the way rabbits do.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And the thing to note here is that
we say ピョンピョン と ".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So once again we're using that
quotation particle.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">In this case we're using it to show
how the rabbit ran, and because this is kind of technically a sound
effect, we're "quoting" the sound the rabbit made in order to tell
the manner in which the rabbit ran.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">It ran in a little-jumps kind of
manner.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span>All right.</span></p>

Lesson 13: "Passive Conjugation" debunked: NOT passive. NOT a
conjugation. IS easy.</a></span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">こんにちは.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Today we're going to talk about the
receptive helper verb.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">In other places you will hear this
referred to as the "passive conjugation".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Now, as we've already learned, there
are no conjugations in Japanese, so it can't be a
conjugation.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Also, it isn't passive.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So that's zero out of two for the
textbooks.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And this matters because if we think
of the receptive helper verb as a passive conjugation, it
completely disrupts our grasp of the structure and, once again, it
throws those poor particles all over the room.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And as we know the particles are the
linchpins, the hinges on which Japanese turns.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So if we mess up the particles we
are in deep trouble.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And this is why so many people find
Japanese hard to understand.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So, now I've mentioned "passive
conjugation" just so you know what we're talking about if you find
it in other contexts, let's drop those words completely and call it
what it is: the receptive helper verb.</span></p>
<h2 class="c22" id="h.whq74ps7t5n"><span class="c16">Receptive
Helper Verb</span></h2>
<p class="c0"><span>So, what is the receptive helper verb?</span>
<span style=
"overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 624.00px; height: 350.67px;">

title=""></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">It's a verb that fits onto the
a-stem of another verb, and the a-stem, that's the same stem that
we use for attaching the ない negative helper adjective, isn't
it?</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">The receptive helper verb is "れる /
られる": that's "れる" for godan verbs, "られる" for ichidan
verbs.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Now, a lot of people panic when they
see that the "られる" of the ichidan receptive helper verb is the same
as the "られる" of the ichidan potential helper verb.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">But there's no need to
panic.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">It's perfectly all right.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">In English we have things like this
as well.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">For example, we have the words "to",
"two" and "too".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And they're all pronounced the same
and they're all very common words that are used hundreds of times
every day.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And how often do they get confused?
Not very often at all.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And it's the same with the potential
and receptive helper verbs.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">They're used in quite different
situations and there's very little chance of confusing them in real
use.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And real use is what
matters.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So, what does the receptive helper
verb mean? It means "receive"or "get".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Receive what? Receive the action of
the verb to which it is attached.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Now, most of the time I'm going to
use the word "get" because this expresses very clearly what the
helper verb does.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Your old English teacher might say
it's not the best way of expressing things, but it's a perfectly
good way of expressing things in English and in Japanese it is
exactly how we do express them.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">All right?</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So, let's take a simple example:
"さくらが 叱られた."</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span style=
"overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 624.00px; height: 350.67px;">
<img alt="" src="images/image98.jpg" style=
"width: 624.00px; height: 350.67px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);"
title=""></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"叱る" means "scold" or "tell off",
and the a-stem is "叱ら", so when we add to that "れる" and put it into
the past tense we get "叱られた".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"叱る" is "scold", "叱られる" is "get
scolded", "叱られた" is "got scolded", so, "Sakura got
scolded".</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Now, there's an important thing to
bear in mind here, and that is that we can sometimes, with a helper
verb attached to a verb, we can, as a sort of railroad shorthand,
condense those two parts into one verb.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span style=
"overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 624.00px; height: 350.67px;">
<img alt="" src="images/image125.jpg" style=
"width: 624.00px; height: 350.67px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);"
title=""></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So we can say "本が 読める" and although
"読める", which is the potential form of "読む", is strictly speaking
"読め" plus "る", we can combine them together and treat "読める" as one
engine.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">But we can't, and never should, do
that with the receptive helper verb.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Why not? Because when the receptive
helper verb is attached to another verb, the action of the first
verb is always done by someone different from the action of the
second verb "れる/られる".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So we always have in a receptive
sentence the action that is done by someone else, whom we may or
may not know, plus the real action of the sentence which is
"れる/られる", the receiving - the getting - of that action.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And this is the fundamental point to
bear in mind.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">It's because the textbooks don't
keep this in mind and don't keep those two engines separate that
all the confusion and difficulty over the so-called "passive
conjugation" arises.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">The head verb of a れる/られる receptive
sentence is always "れる" or "られる", not the verb to which it is
attached.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">All right.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Now, let's also notice that the
A-car, the actor of the sentence, is not necessarily a
person.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So, if we say, "水が 飲まれた" (飲む: drink;
飲ま: a-stem of drink; れた: got), we're saying "the water got
drunk".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span style=
"overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 624.00px; height: 350.67px;">

title=""></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And the actor of that sentence is
the water.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span>Now, even if we add a doer of the action: "水が
犬に 飲まれた", the actor of the sentence is still the water, not the
dog, because it's the water that got drunk, it's the water that did
the getting.</span><span style=
"overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 624.00px; height: 350.67px;"><img alt=""

title=""></span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">The dog did the drinking, but the
water did the getting.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And the dog drinking the water is
all a white section which modifies that final head verb,
"get".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"the water got drunk by the
dog."</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Now why do I mark the dog with に?
I'm going to come to that in just a moment.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Let's get a fuller sentence so we
can see all the particles working together in a receptive
sentence.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Sakuraは 誰かに かばんが 盗まれた" (盗む: steal;
盗ま: a-stem of steal; 盗まれる: get stolen; 盗まれた: got
stolen).</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span style=
"overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 624.00px; height: 350.67px;">

title=""></span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"誰か" means "someone" (dare: who +
ka: question). Who was it? We don't know, no one in particular, but
someone.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"誰か" - "someone".</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So, what's going on here? Who is the
receiver of the action? It's not Sakura, who's marked by は
.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">It's not someone, who's marked by
に.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">It's the person who's marked by が,
and that's the bag.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">The bag is what received that
stealing, so the bag is the subject of the sentence.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">The bag is the one who did "れる", who
did "got".</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And に... what's it doing here? Well,
let's remember that に marks the ultimate target of an
action.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So, "Sakuraに ボールを 投げた"- the が marked
actor is I, the object of the action is "ボール", and the target of
that action is Sakura.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Now, this kind of に can only be used
when we are projecting something, whether it's throwing a ball,
sending a letter, giving a present, lending a book.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">We have to be projecting something
toward the target.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Now, "れる" is not a projecting
verb.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">It's a receiving verb.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">It's not a push-verb, it's a
pull-verb.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Therefore the target of that verb is
not something toward which you are projecting; it is the thing from
which you are receiving.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So に performs the same function in
relation to a pull-verb that it performs in relation to a
push-verb, that is, the ultimate target of the push, the ultimate
source of the pull.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So you see, all the particles are
doing exactly what they always do.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Nothing is changing here.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">If you think of it as "passive
conjugation", all the particles do a strange dance and seem to be
doing different things from what they usually do, but if you
understand it as it is - the receptive helper verb - there isn't
any problem.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And it all makes sense, just the way
Japanese always does if you know what it's really doing.</span></p>
<h2 class="c22" id="h.sn5h16y22ycc"><span class="c16">Nuisance
Receptive</span></h2>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Now, there's one other area in which
the receptive sometimes confuses people, and that is in the
so-called "suffering passive" or "adversity passive", which is
actually called in Japanese the "迷惑受け身", which means the "nuisance
receptive".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And that's what it is.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">It's the nuisance
receptive.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Sakuraは 誰かに かばんが 盗まれた" means
"Sakura's bag got stolen by someone" or, literally, "In relation to
Sakura, bag got stolen by someone".</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span style=

title=""></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">But we can also say "さくらが 誰かに かばん を
盗まれた".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span style=

title=""></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">What happens here? This is the
nuisance receptive.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So what's happening here? The が
marked actor is now Sakura, isn't it? She is the one who does the
receiving.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So what does this sentence mean in
English? Very simple: "Sakura got her bag stolen".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">That's what we say in English; our
old English teacher might not like it, but we say it in English, it
makes sense in English, and it's exactly what we say in
Japanese.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Sakura got her bag stolen by
someone."</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span>So, I think you can see that there is in fact
no problem, no difficulty, no confusion about the receptive helper
verb, just so long as you know that it is a receptive helper verb
and not something else.</span></p>

<p class="c0"><span class="c1">If you remember, Alice had spotted a

<p class="c0"><span class="c1">The white rabbit looked at his watch
and said, "I'm late! I'm late!" and ran off.</span></p>

<p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;"飛び上がる" is another one of
those words of the kind we looked at last week, where a verb is
joined to the い-stem of another verb to create a new
verb.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">The first verb here is 飛ぶ, which
means either "jump"or "fly".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">In this case, it obviously means
"jump", since Alice can't fly.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And あがる means "rise up".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So when you put them together, 飛び上がる
means "jump up".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And we might notice that あがる here,
it's the same kanji as "上", which means "up", and "上がる" is a verb
meaning "rise up", and we can see that it's related to "上げる", which
we looked at recently, and that means to "give to someone upwards /
(to) raise up toward someone else".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">But "あがる" means for something to
"raise itself up / rise up in itself".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So we can see that the two are
related.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">They're both "upping"
verbs.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"うさぎの 後を 追った."</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;"後" means "behind" or "after",
and "追う" (which is spelled おう) means "follow".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"後を 追う" is a common expression and
it means to "follow after / follow behind".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">But, as we've seen before, these
positional expressions are always nouns in Japanese.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">We talk about the "on" of the table,
the "under" of the table, the "beside"of the river.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And here we're talking about the
"behind"or the "after" of the rabbit.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So Alice followed the "rabbit's
after" or the "rabbit's behind".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">This is how we put it in
Japanese.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">" アリスは 飛び上がって, うさぎの 後を

<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Alice jumped up and followed after

<p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;"しゃべるうさぎを

title=""></span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;"しゃべる" means "talk" or
"chatter". It's a bit like "jabber" in English, isn't
it?</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;"しゃべる うさぎ" – in this case
obviously "しゃべる", the verb, is being used, as any verb-engine can
be used, as an adjective.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So "しゃべる うさぎ" is a "talking rabbit"
or a "talk-rabbit" literally.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"見た ことが ない" is a usage we're going
to find very often: "ことが ない" , "ことが ある".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">What does it mean? Well, "こと", as we
know, means a "thing" and it means a thing in an abstract sense, a
condition, not a concrete thing like a pen or a book.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So, "見た こと":</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"見た" is modifying the noun "こと",
isn't it? It's telling us what kind of "こと" it is, and in this case
"見る" means "see" , "見た" is "see" in the past tense, so the "こと" is
actually "seeing" in the past tense.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So "見た こと" means "the fact of having
seen".</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"見た ことが ない" means "the fact of
having seen does not exist".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So what this is saying is, "Alice
had never seen a talking rabbit".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">(" the fact of having seen a talking
rabbit does not exist") "しゃべる うさぎを &nbsp;見た ことが ない" – "Alice had
never seen a talking rabbit."</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And of course in English we always
want to make Alice the actor of this sentence, but actually the
subject of this sentence, the A-car, is not Alice, it's
"こと".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Even if we put Alice into the
sentence, we would say, "アリスは しゃべる うさぎを &nbsp;見た ことが
ない".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">She would still not be the actor of
the sentence. She would just be the topic about which the sentence
was.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Speaking of Alice, the fact of
having seen a talking rabbit does not exist."</span></p>

<p class="c0"><span class="c1">I'll tell you what it means to start
with.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">It means "the rabbit ran quickly and
suddenly jumped into a rabbit-hole".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So let's look at it bit by
bit.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"うさぎは 早く 走って"</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Now, "走る", as we know, is
"run";</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"早い" is an adjective meaning "fast"
or "early".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">In this case, it obviously means
"fast"– we know the rabbit wasn't early, don't we?</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">If we want to say "the rabbit is
fast", we would say "うさぎが 早い".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">If we want to say that its movement
is fast, its action is fast, we need an adverb.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">An adverb is an adjective that
describes not an object, not a noun, but a verb.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Now, we can turn any adjective into
an adverb in Japanese very easily.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">All we do is we take the regular
i-ending adjective and use its stem く.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span style=

<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So "早い" becomes "早く".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"早い" is an adjective describing a
thing; "早く" is an adverb describing an action.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So, "うさぎは 早く 走って" – "the rabbit ran
fast".</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"急に うさぎの 穴に 飛び込んだ."</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Now, "うさぎの 穴": "穴" means "hole", so
"うさぎの 穴" means "rabbit-hole".</span></p>
<h2 class="c22" id="h.2pihxfg419ph"><span class=
"c16">込む</span></h2>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">" 飛び込む" is another one of these
compound verbs.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"飛ぶ", as we know, means "jump", and
"込む" means to "go into" something.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">It's not just like "enter"; it tends
to be to "put into", to "force into", to do an action into
something.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So we have a lot of verbs actually
which are made up with "込む", which is "doing an action into"
something.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So "飛び込む" means "jump into", quite
simply "jump into".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So, the rabbit "jumped into a
rabbit-hole."</span></p>

title=""></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">But "急に", what does that
mean?</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Well, "急" is a noun and it means
"sudden".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And when we put に onto the end of it
we turn that into an adverb as well.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So here we have two kinds of
adverbs.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">We can form an adverb from an
adjective by simply using its く-stem.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And we form an adverb from a noun by
adding に.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And this works with some regular
nouns and pretty much all adjectival nouns.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So, "急" means "sudden"or "abrupt" ;
"急に" means "suddenly".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"the rabbit suddenly jumped into a
rabbit-hole"</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So, the entire sentence: "うさぎは 早く
走って, 急に うさぎの 穴に 飛び込んだ"–</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"the rabbit ran fast and suddenly
jumped into a rabbit-hole"</span></p>
<h2 class="c22" id="h.xbyhk9pbaznk"><span class="c16">Particle
も</span></h2>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"アリスも うさぎの 穴に 飛び込んだ." – "Alice also
jumped into the rabbit-hole."</span></p>

<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Now here we're going to meet a new
element that we haven't covered before, and that is the
も-flag.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"も" is a flag, just like は
.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Why is that? Well, we know that は is
a non-logical topic-marking particle, don't we? "も" is another
non-logical topic-marking particle; in fact, it's the only other
non-logical topic-marking particle.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So も marks the topic of the sentence
just the way は does.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">What's the difference between
them?</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Well, は , as we know, declares the
topic of the sentence, and obviously it can also change the topic
of the sentence.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">If we're talking about one thing and
we declare a new は topic, we have changed the topic of the
sentence.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Now, も declares the topic of the
sentence as well, but it always changes it.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">You can't use も unless there is a
topic already current in the conversation.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So, the topic of our conversation up
to this point has been the rabbit: the rabbit jumped into the
hole.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And now we're changing the topic to
Alice.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">" アリスも うさぎの 穴に 飛び込んだ."</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">When we change the topic with も, we
are saying that the comment about this topic is the same as the
comment on the previous topic, the topic we're changing
from.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">When we change the topic with は , we
are doing the opposite of that: we are drawing a distinction
between the present topic and the previous topic.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So if we had said, "アリスは お姉ちゃんの ところに
戻った"</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"ところ" is "place" and "戻る" is
"return", so this would have meant Alice went back to her sister,
to the place where her sister was, to her sister's
place.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">If we'd said this, that は would have
been drawing a distinction between what the rabbit did and what
Alice did.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">We would be saying, "the rabbit
jumped into the rabbit-hole. As for Alice, she returned to her
sister".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And you see that in English
too.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">This has the implication that what
Alice did was different from what the rabbit did.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"the rabbit jumped into the
rabbit-hole. As for Alice, she went back to her sister." this is
what は does.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">If we'd used が:</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">" アリスが お姉ちゃんの ところに 戻った", we'd simply
have been saying, "the rabbit jumped into the rabbit-hole and Alice
went back to her sister."</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">But with は , we are drawing that
distinction; we are saying, "the rabbit jumped into the
rabbit-hole, but as for Alice, she went back to her
sister."</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Now, if we say も instead of は , then
we are making the opposite point: we are saying that the comment we
made on the rabbit is the same as the comment we're making on
Alice.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"the rabbit jumped into the
rabbit-hole and Alice also jumped into the rabbit-hole"</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So, there are various uses of "も",
which we'll look at later, but this is the most fundamental
one.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">It's the topic-marking particle that
tells us that the comment on the new topic is the same as the
comment on the old topic.</span></p>

<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"中" means "the inside", either the
middle or the inside of something, so "穴の 中" is the inside of the
hole.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"竪穴": the word "竪" means
"vertical"or "upright" (and you can see it's related to "立つ"– to
stand).</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So, "穴の 中は 竪穴 だった" means "the inside
of the hole was a vertical hole"– it went straight down.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"アリスは すぐ 下に 落ちた."</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Now, "下", as we know, is "down" or
"below".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"すぐ" means "direct"; it can mean
"soon" in the sense of English "It'll happen directly (it'll happen
soon)", or it can mean "straight / direct"in the other
sense.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So "すぐ 下" means "straight down /
right down / directly down".</span></p>

<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"驚く" means "be surprised", and "驚いた
こと" is an interesting expression because it literally appears to
mean, doesn't it, a "surprised thing".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">But as we've seen with Japanese
adjectives of emotion and desire, with things that describe emotion
and desire, in Japanese they shift very easily from the thing that
experiences the emotion to the thing that causes the emotion and
back.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So "驚いた こと" here doesn't mean a
"surprised thing", it means a "surprising thing".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And に ("ことに"), is once again that
technique of putting a に, putting に, after a noun to turn it into
an adverb.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So, "驚いた ことに 落ちた." (We'll come to
"ゆっくり"in just a moment.) It means "surprisingly fell / she fell in
a surprising manner".</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And what kind of a surprising manner
was this? "ゆっくり ゆっくり".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Now, "ゆっくり" is a very common word
that we'll encounter.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">It's a slightly unusual kind of
adverb – the third kind of adverb we're going to encounter commonly
in Japanese.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">The first two kinds, as we see, are
the く-stem of an adjective or a noun with に.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"ゆっくり" is slightly unusual in that
it is fundamentally a noun which can be applied as an adverb but we
don't need to use に with it.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">It stands on its own.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"ゆっくり ゆっくり 落ちた".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"ゆっくり" means "slowly / leisurely /

Lesson 15: Transitivity- the 3 facts that make it easy.
Transitive/intransitive verbs unlocked</a></span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">こんにちは.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Today we're going to look at
self-move and other-move words.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">If you look in a standard Japanese
textbook or dictionary, you usually see these defined as
"transitive" and "intransitive" verbs.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Now, this isn't as far off as some
of the things you find in these books, such as conjugation, which
doesn't exist in Japanese; passive (there is no passive in
Japanese).</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Transitivity and intransitivity does
exist in Japanese and most of the time there is a big overlap
between that and self-move and other-move verbs.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">However, it doesn't work all the
time and it isn't exactly what is meant by self-move and other-move
in Japanese.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So, if you're familiar and
comfortable with the Western terms "transitive" and "intransitive",
it doesn't hurt a lot if you use them, at least not most of the
time.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">But if you're not familiar with
them, don't try to learn them just for the sake of Japanese,
because they're not really accurate.</span></p>
<h2 class="c22" id="h.hxqiogyz6hcy"><span class="c16">What’s the
difference ?</span></h2>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So what are self-move and other-move
words? In Japanese, a move word, "どうし", is a verb, a word that
denotes an action or a movement.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So a self-move word is any verb that
moves itself.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So if I stand up, that's a self-move
action.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">I'm not moving something else, I'm
moving myself.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">If I throw a ball, that's an
other-move action.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">I'm not throwing myself, I'm
throwing the ball.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And really it's as simple as
that.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span style=
"overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 624.00px; height: 350.67px;">

title=""></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Now, Japanese has a lot of pairs of
words – so we could say they're either two forms of the same word
or two very closely related words – where we have a self-move and
an other-move version.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So, one very good example is "出る"
and "出す".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">They both use the same kanji which
means "come out".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">The base form is "出る" and that means
simply "come out"or "emerge", and that's the self-move
version.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">The other-move version is "出す" and
that means "take out"or "bring out": cause something to come
out.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span style=
"overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 624.00px; height: 350.67px;">
<img alt="" src="images/image81.jpg" style=
"width: 624.00px; height: 350.67px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);"
title=""></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So in the first case whatever it is
is moving itself; it's coming out; it's emerging.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">In the second case, the actor of the
sentence, the actor of the verb, is bringing something else out or
taking something else out.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Now, this is often very useful,
because in many cases it gives us two distinct words that are easy
to understand because they're closely related.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">For example, "負ける" means "lose"– it
doesn't mean lose an object or lose money, but lose a contest, lose
a war, lose a battle, lose a game – be defeated, in other
words.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Now, "負かす", which is the other-move
version of "負ける", means "defeat"– in other words, cause someone
else to lose.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span style=
"overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 624.00px; height: 350.67px;">

title=""></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So where we have two words in
English, "lose" and "defeat", in Japanese we have fundamentally the
same word in its self-move and its other-move versions.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<h2 class="c22" id="h.89nqrcg3pfou"><span class="c16">How to
recognize the pairs ?</span></h2>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So that's very useful – but not so
useful if you don't understand how to form self-move and other-move
versions of a word.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">If you look in the standard
textbooks, most of the time they're going to tell you that you just
have to learn all the self-move and all the other-move words
separately.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Sometimes they give you lists of
self-move and other-move pairs – transitivity pairs, as they call
them.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">But this isn't true and it isn't
necessary.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Most of the time we can tell which
is a self-move word and which is an other-move word.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">There are a few very simple rules
that cover most of the move word pairs.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And those rules are even easier if
you understand the logic that underlies them.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And that's what we're going to learn
right now.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">The first thing to know is that
there is, as it were, an Adam and Eve of self-move and other-move
words, the mother and father of them all.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And these are "ある" and
"する".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span style=
"overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 624.00px; height: 350.67px;">

title=""></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"ある" is the mother of all self-move
words.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">It simply means "be".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So it's a completely inward-directed
verb.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">You can't be or exist something
else; you can only be and exist in yourself.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">It's fundamentally and absolutely
inward-directed, self-directed.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"する", on the other hand, means
"do".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So they mean "be" and
"do".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And "する" in itself, just doing, can
never exist on its own you have to be doing something.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So this is the father of all
other-move verbs.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Now why do we need to know that, why
is it important to know that? Because when we know that, it unlocks
most of the move word pairs that we're going to
encounter.</span></p>
<h2 class="c22" id="h.5xi6all2pxl"><span class="c16">3 Laws to
recognize the pairs</span></h2>
<p class="c0"><span>How does it do that? Well, there are what I
call 3 laws of move word pairs.</span><span style=
"overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 624.00px; height: 350.67px;"><img alt=""

title=""></span></p>
<h3 class="c11" id="h.wfbceq5jkad8"><span class="c29">Law
1</span></h3>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And the first of those laws is that
if one of a pair ends in す, that is going to be the other-move
word, always.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Why? Because that す is related to
"する".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So, in the example we gave before,
"出る / 出す", "出る" means "come out" and "出す", which ends in す, is the
other-move verb – that's the one that means "take (something else)
out".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">In "負ける / 負かす", we know that the
other-move verb, the verb that means "make (someone else) lose" is
"負かす" because it ends in す.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span>And an awful lot of</span> <span>those す
pairs</span><span>&nbsp;actually make that particular
transformation</span><span>, える</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;to
す.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">But not always.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">In some cases... we have, for
example, "落ちる", which means "fall", and "落とす", which means
"drop".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">They have the same kanji; they are a
pair, they don't have that regular える to す ending, but "落とす" still
has す on the end, so we still know that that is the other-move
partner of the pair.</span></p>
<h3 class="c11" id="h.un4di0zi3j0p"><span class="c29">Law
2</span></h3>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Now, the second rule is that where
one of a pair ends in any of the a-stem + る , so it ends in the
sound ある, that is going to be the self-move partner of the
pair.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Why? Because that ある is related to
"ある", the mother of all self-move verbs.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">The usual pattern here is える to
ある.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">We already looked at that in the
last lesson, where we have "あがる", which means "rise up/get up", and
"あげる", which means "raise (something) up".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">It is very often used to mean to
"give (something) upward (to another person)".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So we have "あがる" and "あげる", and we
know that the self-move partner of the pair is "あがる" because it
ends in ある.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">The usual form here is える to ある, but
again it doesn't have to be.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">There are other cases, such as "包む",
which means "wrap", and "包まる", which means "be wrapped", but again
it doesn't matter because we know that the one ending in ある is
always going to be the self-move partner of the pair.</span></p>
<h3 class="c11" id="h.cv309vf6cw0j"><span class="c29">Law
3</span></h3>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Now, the third law is that if we
take any regular verb ending in う sound (as they all do) and change
it to the え-row and add る , which means that it ends in える, that
flips a self-move word to an other-move word or an other-move word
to a self-move word.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">The problem is that we don't know in
every case know from the structure which way the word will be
flipped.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">However, this is not as difficult as
it seems, because first of all this is not a large number of verbs
– the majority are covered by the first two rules – and of this
group of う to える flips, the majority is む to める.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span style=
"overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 624.00px; height: 350.67px;">

title=""></span></p>
<h3 class="c11" id="h.dvsvibuyz1d0"><span class="c29">Law
4</span></h3>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And める is – I would call this an
honorary member of the す family.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Or you could say that む to める is the
honorary fourth law.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Whichever way you put it, in む to
める, める is always the other-move partner of the pair.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And indeed as you get more
experienced in Japanese, you will get to feel that める-ending verbs
have a する-like other-move feeling to them.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And this really is all you need to
know if you're beginning with self-move / other-move verbs, because
this covers really the vast majority of all the pairs you're going
to encounter.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So don't feel that you have to learn
the rest of this lesson.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">You can come back to it later
whenever you want to.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">But I'm going to just complete it,
partly so that you have all the information you might need for the
future and partly because it's going to give us more insight into
how self-move and other-move really works.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So the next thing to know is that as
well as む / める, which is the big one, there are also other honorary
members of the す family and these are: ぶ to べる.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">べる is always the other-move version
(and ぶ and む are very close in Japanese; you may know "さびしい / さみしい"
and other words like that, where you can just use ぶ or む in the
same word, so める and -べる naturally are both honorary members of the
す family).</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span style=
"overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 624.00px; height: 350.67px;">

title=""></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And also -つ / てる – the てる is always
the other-move pair.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So in the end we really have very
few wild cards in this pack.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">The only ones that we really can't
tell which way they are going is く and ぐ, to ける and げる, う to える,
and those る-ending verbs that don't fit either of the first two
laws.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So these are in fact the only
exceptions where you really can't tell structurally which way they
are going.</span></p>
<h2 class="c22" id="h.lef60s1a6bfc"><span class=
"c16">Advanced</span></h2>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So is there anything we can actually
do about this last small minority of self-move/other-move
flips?</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And the answer to that is
yes.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">But it's a little bit subtler and it
will become easier as you become more competent in
Japanese.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So you don't need to worry about
this if you're at an early stage.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">The rules I've given you cover most
of the cases.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">But when we take a verb that
structurally you can't tell which way it's flipping, a lot of the
time we can tell semantically – that's to say, that when I say that
the え-row plus る flips transitivity, I mean exactly
that.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">The える version is the flipped
version; the う version is the original, the one that's in the basic
form of the verb.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span style=
"overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 624.00px; height: 350.67px;">
<img alt="" src="images/image42.jpg" style=
"width: 624.00px; height: 350.67px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);"
title=""></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So to take an example, "売る" means
"sell"; it's a very common word.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">There's a less common version of it
which is "売れる", and that's the flipped version.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Now, "selling" is obviously an
other-move verb – I sell something.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">You can't just sell in the
abstract.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">I sell something-or-other and so I'm
moving that other thing – quite literally.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">But "売れる" means "sell" in the other
sense, as in "that game is selling like hot cakes".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So in this case, they're talking
about a book selling or a game selling, so the thing that is doing
the selling here is also the thing that is moving, so this is a
self-move version, isn't it?</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span>So it's clear that "売る" is basically</span>
<span>an other-move</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;verb but when it's
flipped it has a self-move version.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span style=
"overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 624.00px; height: 350.67px;">
<img alt="" src="images/image24.jpg" style=
"width: 624.00px; height: 350.67px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);"
title=""></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Now, if we take one that goes the
other way, "従う" means "obey" or "follow", and it has a flipped
version, "従える", which means to "be followed by" or "be obeyed
by".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Now, it's clear here that the basic
idea is obeying or following and that the extended idea is being
obeyed or being followed.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So here it's clear that the
other-move version is going to be the える version, because that's
the flipped version of the basic concept, to obey or
follow.</span></p>
<h2 class="c22" id="h.5w1lwp12knaa"><span class="c16">Self Move and
Other Move</span></h2>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And we can also note here for those
of you who've been asking yourselves, "why does she say that
transitive and intransitive aren't correct?"– this is an
example.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">The Japanese-English dictionaries
tell us that "従う" is the intransitive version, but if you think
about it "従う" means "obey"or "follow".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">This is not an intransitive
word.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">You can't just obey or follow in the
abstract.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">You obey someone or you follow
someone.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">It's a transitive verb.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So why do the dictionaries call it
intransitive? Because they have made the commitment to translating
self-move as intransitive, but while it's a transitive verb – you
obey someone, you follow someone – it is also a self-move
verb.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">In obeying someone or following
someone, you are not moving that other person.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">You are moving yourself.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">In being obeyed or being followed,
you are not moving yourself, you're moving that other
person.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So this is one of the cases where
self-move and other-move do not correspond to transitive and
intransitive.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">There aren't too many of those
cases, so it doesn't matter if you want to use transitive and
intransitive, just be aware that the meaning is not exactly the
same in any case, and in some cases it doesn't fit at
all.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Now, as I say, if you just want to
remember the three rules and nothing else, that is going to break
the back of self-move and other-move verbs for you.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">In most cases, you can understand
them with nothing but that.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So the rest of what I've told you is
very useful as you become more proficient at Japanese, but if you
just remember the concept of self-move and other-move and the three
basic rules – the ある version is always self-move, the す and -seru
versions are always other-move and if you also remember that the める
version is always other-move, that's worth throwing in because that
covers a lot.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span>And with those, you really have the problem of
self-move and other-move verbs mostly under control.</span></p>

<li class="c19 c20 li-bullet-0"><span class="c1">"間" is a period of
time and it's also the space between two things.</span></li>
</ul>
<p class="c19 c28 c43"><span class="c1">And obviously a period of
time is always, metaphorically speaking - and we can only really
talk about time in spatial metaphors - a period of time is always a
space between two points, isn't it? It has a beginning and it has
an end.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So "落ちる 間に" means "while she was
falling / during the period of time while she was
falling".</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<ul class="c13 lst-kix_jjza3hclyx0-0 start">

and it can be used in both a positive or a negative
sense.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">It can mean free time to do what you
want to do, or it can mean empty time, being bored, having time
hanging on your hands.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Here it just means having plenty of
time available to look around, because she's falling, she can't do
anything else, and she's falling rather slowly.</span></p>

<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And here it's an adverb describing
the fact that the "ひま", the "free time", exists.</span></p>

<li class="c17 c30 li-bullet-0"><span class="c1">"まわりを ゆっくり 見まわせた"-
is interesting because this is another example of what we were
talking about last week: self-move/other-move pairs.</span></li>
</ul>
<p class="c19"><span class="c1">"まわる" means to "go around/move
around".</span></p>
<p class="c19"><span class="c1">The rather childish name for a
policeman is "おまわりさん", which means "someone who goes around /
someone who does the rounds".</span></p>
<p class="c19"><span class="c1">"まわす" means "make (something) go
around/to send (something) around/to cause it to go around" and of
course, as we learned last week, we easily know which of the pair
is the self-move word (going around) and which is the other-move
word (sending around) because the sending-around one ends in
す.</span></p>
<p class="c19 c2"></p>
<p class="c19"><span>Now</span><span>, we</span><span class=
"c1">&nbsp;don't actually have "まわる" here; we have
"まわり".</span></p>
<p class="c19"><span class="c1">And as we've mentioned before, when

becomes a noun.</span></p>
<p class="c19"><span class="c1">There is another use which we're

a noun.</span></p>
<p class="c19"><span>So</span><span>, what</span><span class=

<p class="c19"><span>"まわり" can actually</span>

someone who does the act of doing the rounds, "まわり" is "the act of
doing the rounds", but it can also mean "the surroundings", and in

<li class="c17 c30 li-bullet-0"><span class="c1">So, "まわりを ゆっくり

<p class="c0"><span>("ゆっくり"</span><span>, that</span><span class=
"c1">&nbsp;adverb we learned last week) ... she could in a
leisurely manner “みまわす”.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">What does "みまわす" mean? We know what
"まわす" means - it means to "make (something) go around".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"みまわす" is attaching "まわす" to the
い-stem of "見る".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">We can't actually tell it's the
い-stem, because this is an ichidan verb, and all ichidan stems look
the same, as we know, but we know that this is in fact the 連用形, the
い-stem, because that's the one that gets used for attaching verbs
to other verbs.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span>So, "</span><span>みまわす</span><span class="c1">"
means literally "send your looking around / send your eye-beams
around the place / make your looking go around".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So, "まわりを みまわす" is "look around the
place / send your eye-beams, send your looking around the
place".</span></p>
<ul class="c13 lst-kix_nto2kxete21h-0 start">
<li class="c17 c30 li-bullet-0"><span class="c1">And "みまわせる" is, as
we've seen, the potential form of "みまわす".</span></li>
</ul>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So what this is saying is "because a
lot of time existed she was able to leisurely send her looking
around the surroundings".</span></p>

<h3 class="c27 c51" id="h.d6cscblujx6c"><span class="c29">Phrasal
particle の</span></h3>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">The second clause has quite a lot
for us to consider.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"目に 止まるのは " means literally "the
thing that stopped in her eye".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span>Now this is a similar expression to, in

passed through her eye, passed through her vision, and the thing
that stopped there was what we</span> <span>are</span><span class=

<p class="c0"><span class="c1">As we've seen before, の is like

<p class="c0"><span class="c1">In English you might say, "Sakura's.

<p class="c0"><span class="c1">You could say, "Sakura's dress" but
you don't have to, you can just say, "Sakura's".</span></p>

<p class="c0"><span class="c1">But this can be taken much further
in Japanese, and I've done a whole video about this particular use
of の, which you can look at if you want to go deeper.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">But in this case the way it's taken
further is "目に 止まるの"- this is "the thing, the one that stopped in
her eye".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"which dress do you like best?
Sakura's, Sakura's one, Sakura's thing, Sakura's dress."</span></p>

"looking at the surroundings of the hole, the thing that stopped in

<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"ぎっしり" is yet another one of these
り-ending adverbs that don't need に.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"ぎっしり" means "tightly
packed".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"並んだ" is the past tense of "並ぶ"
which means "lined-up", so "ぎっしり 並んだ" means "tightly lined-up /
packed together / lined-up and packed together".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"ぎっしり 並んだ 戸棚 や 本棚 だった".</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span>All right. Well</span><span>,
we'll</span><span>&nbsp;get to the " や "in just a
moment</span><span>, but</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;"戸棚 や
本棚".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">The word for a shelf in Japanese is
"棚", and when we add something before it to tell us what kind of a
shelf it is, we use that "〃 hooking" that we've talked about
before.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So the "た" becomes "だ" : "戸棚"- that
"戸" means "door", so literally, "戸棚"is a "door-shelf" and that is
the Japanese word for a cupboard.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And it's quite a good word, I think.
That's what a cupboard really is, isn't it? Shelves, with a
door.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">It's a better way of saying cupboard
than the English way which says it's a board on which you put cups,
which isn't quite what a cupboard is.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">" 本棚" is even easier: it's quite
literally a book-shelf, bookshelves.</span></p>
<h3 class="c11" id="h.9bvhglf03svf"><span class="c29">Particles と
and や</span></h3>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Now, this " や" is something we need
to cover.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">When you want to say "and"-
something "and" something else - how do you say it in
Japanese?</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">We know that when you're putting two
clauses together, we use the て-form, or sometimes we use other
things, like "でも".</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">In English we use "and" in all
cases: we say "bread and butter", "pencil and paper".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">We also say "I went into the baker's
and bought some bread."</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">But in Japanese we don't use the
same "and" in the two cases.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">We already know some of the ways we
can "and" two clauses together, but when we're "anding" two things
together, there are two ways to do it.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And one is to use the と
particle.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">We know that the と particle is the
quotation particle, but it's also the “and-particle”.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So if you want to say "pen and
book", we say "ペンと 本".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">But we can also use the や -particle,
so we can say "と" or " や " when we want to "and" together two or
more objects.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span style=

title=""></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">What's the difference? Well, as a
matter of fact it's a very useful difference, and one that we could
do with in English.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">" to" is an exclusive
"and".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">If I say, "what's in that box?" and
you answer "ぺンと えんぴつ" - "pens and pencils"- you are telling me that
there are pens and pencils and nothing else in that box.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">If you say "ぺンや えんぴつ", you're saying
there are pens and pencils and there might also be something else -
and very often you're implying that there is something else because
you're avoiding using the exclusive "and".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So what "stopped in her eye" was the
fact that cupboards and bookshelves (among other things) were
tightly lined around the walls.</span></p>

<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Notice here than "棚の 一つ" is really
just the same as English "one of the shelves" - "棚の 一つ".</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Now, "取る" means "take", and "下ろす"-
the kanji, as you can see, is the kanji for "down", and again this
is part of a move-pair, self-move/other-move pair, which is why I
introduced them early.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Most courses would regard that as an
intermediate thing, self-move and other-move, but I think it makes
it much easier to recognize what words are doing if you're aware of
this.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"降りる" means "come down / step down"-
come down the stairs, come off a bus.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"下ろす" means "bring down".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And once again, we know which is the
other-move one - you "bring (something else) down"- that's the one
that ends in す: "下ろす".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So "取り下ろす" means "take and bring
down". "棚の 一つから 瓶を 取り下ろした."</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"From one of the shelves she took
down..."</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"瓶" usually gets translated as
"bottle"; in fact in this case I think it was more of a
"jar".</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span>What was in it? Well, we'll have to wait till
next time to find out.</span></p>

Lesson 17: How desu/masu RUINS your Japanese! + How to use it
correctly. Plus the volitional</a></span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">こんにちは.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Today we're going to talk about
formal Japanese: です/ます.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Some people may be surprised that
we've gone for sixteen lessons without using this at all, when most
courses use it from the very first lesson.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Now, there are good reasons why we
haven't.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">One reason is that です/ます form is
actually quite eccentric.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span>It does various things that most of the rest of
Japanese</span> <span>doesn't</span><span class=
"c1">&nbsp;do.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So if we learn this as the standard
way to speak, we get all sorts of strange ideas about the way
Japanese works.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">We could have started learning it a
little earlier, but frankly I think that there are more important
priorities and that it's a good idea to get real, standard Japanese
firmly fixed in our minds before we enter the rather troubled area
of です/ます.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">It isn't difficult once you have
very firmly established standard Japanese structures in your mind,
and we've done that now.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">If you haven't done it yet, if you
haven't followed this course, please go back to the first lesson
right now.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Off you go.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Right.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Now for the rest of you, let's start
with "ます".</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<h2 class="c22" id="h.mdvain99dwca"><span class=
"c16">ます</span></h2>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"ます" is a verb.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">It's not part of a verb, it's a verb
in itself.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">It's a helper verb like lots of
other helper verbs that we've looked at up to this
point.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">It attaches to our old friend the
い-stem, and it doesn't change the meaning of the word it attaches
to in any way.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">It simply makes it
formal.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span style=
"overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 624.00px; height: 350.67px;">

title=""></span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So "歩く" becomes "歩きます" ; "話す"
becomes " 話します", and so forth.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And they're simply the formal way of
saying "speak", "walk", etc.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Now, another reason I didn't teach
this earlier is because people say there are only two irregular
verbs in Japanese – I've said this myself – but the truth is that
there is another one, and it's "ます".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And "ます" isn't irregular in the way
that "来る" and "する" are irregular.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">It's much worse.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">It does something that is done
nowhere else in modern Japanese.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Now the good news is that the past
tense is completely regular and normal.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">It works the same way as any other
す-ending verb: it's "ました".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">But the negative is not "masanai";
it's "ません".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And what kind of a word is "ません"?
It's really nothing that exists in modern Japanese at
all.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">The textbooks tell us that it's the
negative form of the verb, but then they tell us that the verb is
whatever "ます" is attached to, and they also tell us that "ない" is
the negative form of a verb when it's nothing of the sort. It's a
helper adjective.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">We don't need to go into what "ません"
actually is, structurally, because it doesn't happen anywhere else
in modern Japanese, so we just learn it as a fact.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">The negative of "ます" is
"ません".</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And that's another reason I didn't
teach it earlier, because there isn't much of this in Japanese:
things that you just have to learn "as a fact".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">If you know the principles behind
things, generally speaking you can understand how everything works
without a lot of memorization.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So when you start off learning that
you just have to learn that the negative of "ます-verbs", as they're
called – in other words, the ます-helper verb – is "ません", you start
off with the idea that Japanese just does various random things
like a European language.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Now, the negative past gets even
stranger.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">There isn't any past of せん, the way
ない becomes なかった, so what do we do? We just throw the past tense of
"です" on to the end of "ません" and say "ませんでした".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">" 歩きませんでした" – "I didn't
walk".</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">A lot of Japanese people who study
Japanese grammar really dislike this, and I can't blame
them.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">But it has, for better or worse,
become standard Japanese grammar, so we just have to remember
it.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">It's really only a couple of
irregularities and they're not really difficult to remember just so
long as we don't learn them at the beginning, where they confuse
our whole understanding of Japanese.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">If we learn "ます" as a so-called
"conjugation" and we believe that that is the base-form of the
verb, then to make other forms of verbs we find ourselves taking
off the -ます and then changing the い-stem for a different kind of
stem in order to do something else.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Which would be complicated enough if
we knew about stems but the textbooks don't tell us that either, so
we've just got a lot of completely random European-style rules and
regulations that make no sense at all.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<h2 class="c22" id="h.3l3k1f7qymkf"><span class=
"c16">です</span></h2>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So let's move on to "です".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span>"です"</span><span>, as</span><span>&nbsp;you
know</span><span>, is</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;the formal
version of "だ".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">It's the copula.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">It works exactly like "だ" , so if
you know "だ" , you know "です" already.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Except that this also has a strange
quirk, which is that if we take an adjective like "赤い" meaning "is
red", we put "です" on to the end of it in formal speech.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">It doesn't do anything; it just
decorates the sentence and makes it formal.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Again, this is something you just
have to learn and it's not very difficult to learn, but if you
learn it at the beginning you get the impression that you need the
copula with an adjective like "赤い" just as you need the copula with
an adjectival noun like "きれい".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And of course the fact that they
call adjectival nouns "な-adjectives" just makes it even more
confusing.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">You think that adjectives take the
copula and they don't.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Real adjectives, い-Adjectives, do
not take the copula except that in the rather strange です / ます form,
we pop "です" on the end just for decoration.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Adjectival nouns, on the other hand,
of course do take the copula because they're nouns – and all nouns
take the copula.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So we say</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"赤い" – "is red"/ "きれい だ" – "is
pretty" ;</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"赤い です" – "is red" with a
decoration; "きれい です" – "is pretty" with the proper copula that it
needs in the formal form.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span style=

title=""></span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So as you see, formal Japanese is
not really all that difficult.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">We have to learn a few rather
strange facts, and it's not like most of the rest of Japanese which
is terribly Lego-like and logical.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">It's got little quirky bits and
pieces to it, but not many and so long as you've got real Japanese
fixed firmly in your mind, adding on です/ます form is not particularly
difficult.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">A couple of other things worth
knowing: one of the things is that as well as saying "ません", we can
also say "ない です".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So we can say "さくらが 話しません" – "Sakura
doesn't talk", or we can say "さくらが 話さない です".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And that of course is perfectly
logical and sensible, if any of it is, because since we put "です" on
to the end of adjectives in formal speech, we can also put it on to
the end of the ない-helper adjective, which is really just another
adjective.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">We don't make many changes to "ます"
because it really is a sentence-ender; we put it right at the end
of whatever else we're doing in order to add formality to the
sentence.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span style=
"overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 624.00px; height: 350.67px;">

title=""></span></p>
<h2 class="c22" id="h.q22y8vl38xd3"><span class=
"c16">Volitional</span></h2>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">However, we can use both "です" and
"ます" with the volitional helper verb.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And once again "ます" behaves
eccentrically, because its お-stem is not, as you would expect,
"maso" but "ましょう".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So the volitional form is
"ましょう".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Fortunately, this is only slightly
eccentric and not difficult to manage.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And also fortunately, "です" forms a
matching pair with "ます" in the volitional form and becomes
"でしょう".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And since we're raising the subject
of the volitional, let's cover that too.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Its formation is very simple, and
it's one of the few things that we do with the お-stem of
verbs.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span style=
"overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 624.00px; height: 350.67px;">
<img alt="" src="images/image147.jpg" style=

title=""></span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">The godan volitional helper, like
the potential helper – potential helper is just a single kana, る
(る), and the volitional helper is just the single kana う(-u), and
we put it on to the end of the お-stem and it lengthens the o そう
nd.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So, "話す" becomes "話そう", "歩く" becomes
"歩こう" and so forth.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">What does it mean? Well, the name
really tells you what it means.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Volition" means "will", so the
volitional expresses or invokes the will.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">The most usual use of it is setting
the will of a group of people in a particular direction.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So we say, "行きましょう", "Let's
go".</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And some people call the たい-helper
adjective volitional as well, which is confusing because they
aren't the same thing.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And the thing here to remember is
that たい expresses desire, want, wanting to do something.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">The volitional form expresses
will.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And will and desire aren't the same
thing.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">For example, you may have a will to
do your homework.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">It doesn't mean that you want to do
your homework.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">What you actually want is to play
"Captain Toad", but you set your will to doing your
homework.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And when we say things like "行こう",
"let's go", for things that we might all want to do, "let's all
have a picnic", "let's have a party", but also "let's tidy the
room", "let's do our homework." It's expressing will, not
want.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">You'll very often see on Japanese
signs things like, "ゴミを 持ち帰りましょう" – "let's pick up our trash and
take it home"– which always seems to me like quite a nice kind of
exhortation, rather different from the Western signs that say,
"Pick up your rubbish or we'll confiscate your car and dye your
children purple".</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Now, there are a number of uses of
the volitional along with particles like か and と , but we're not
going to go into them here, because I don't think that learning
lists of usages is a good way to learn.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">We'll tackle these as we come to
them, perhaps in the course of Alice's adventures.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">But one use of this form that is
worth knowing because you'll see it pretty often is that we use the
volitional form of the copula, "だ" or "です" – "だ" , which isn't
really a verb in the usual sense, the volitional is "だろう"­– and if
we add that to any other sentence it gives the meaning of
"probably".</span></p>
<ul class="c13 lst-kix_hkqerdyvyn4k-0 start">
<li class="c17 c30 li-bullet-0"><span class="c1">"それは 赤い でしょう" –
"that's probably red/I think it's red"</span></li>
<li class="c17 c30 li-bullet-0"><span class="c1">"さくらが 来る でしょう" –
"I think Sakura's coming/ Sakura's probably coming".</span></li>
</ul>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So now we know how to use the
volitional and how to use formal Japanese.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span>So, "行きましょう" – Let's go.</span></p>

<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Today we're going to talk about
"trying to do something" and from there we're going to broaden out
into the wider meanings of the "と"quotation particle because this
is a very central part of Japanese that's used all the
time.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So we need to get a firm
understanding of what it is and how it works.</span></p>
<h2 class="c22" id="h.qcgkgrkffbh"><span class=

<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Now, last week we learned the
volitional helper う and よう which makes a word end with the sound
"ou" or "you" and expresses will.</span></p>

use the volitional for this.</span></p>

<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So if we say, " 山に のぼろうと する", this
means "try to climb mountain".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Why does it mean that? What's this
construction actually doing?</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Well, "のぼろう" expresses the will to
climb.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">If we say " 山に のぼろう", we're saying,
"Let's climb the mountain".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Literally, set our will toward
climbing the mountain.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"のぼろうと する" means doing the act
implied by setting our will to climb the mountain.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">If we just wanted to say "climb the
mountain", we'd just say, " 山に のぼろう".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">But we're not saying "climb the
mountain", we're saying "try to climb the mountain".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Therefore, do the action implied in
setting our will / enact our will to climb the mountain, whether we
succeed in actually climbing it or not.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Some people find the distinction
between "try climbing" and "try to climb" confusing.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And that's really only because of
the way it's expressed in English.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">In Japanese, as we learned recently,
if we want to say, "try climbing the mountain", we say, " 山に のぼって
見る."</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">The difference is that "try climbing
/ try eating / try swimming" doesn't imply any doubt about the fact
that we can actually do it.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">It implies doubt about what would be
the result when we've done it.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"try eating"- we know we can eat,
but don't know if we'll like it.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"try eating" - "食べて 見る"- means "eat
and see".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Eat it and then see what the result
is, see if you like it, see if you don't like it.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"山に のぼって 見る" means "climb the
mountain and see".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">See whether it was hard, see what
the view's like from the top.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"ケーキを 食べようと する" - "try to eat the
cake"- implies that we don't know whether you can in fact eat the
cake or not, but try it anyway.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Maybe it's a huge cake and it would
be very hard to eat it all.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So "して見る" - "do and see"- implies
that there's no doubt about the fact that we can do it, but there
is some doubt about what the result of having done it is going to
be.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Are we going to like it? Is the
building going to fall down? We don't know what will happen when
we've done it, but we know we can do it.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"しようとする" implies that we don't know
whether we can do it or not, but we are going to try to do
it.</span></p>
<h2 class="c22" id="h.kd2zday9wm5z"><span class=
"c16">とする</span></h2>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So, an important thing here is to
see what the と particle is doing.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;と is encapsulating the
sentence that came before it: " 山に のぼろう"- will to climb the
mountain.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">It isn't quoting it.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">It's not something we've said; it's
not something we've thought, exactly.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">The point is that it's taking the
essence, the meaning, the import of that " 山に のぼろう" and putting it
into action.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And we're going to find that in
other cases.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span style=

title=""></span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">For example, we may read that
someone "ホッとした". Now, what does that mean? "ホッ"is in fact a sound
effect.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">It's the sound effect of breathing a
sigh of relief: " ホッ".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">But "ホッとする" actually does not mean
"breathe a sigh of relief".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">What it means is, "feel relief / be
relieved".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So what we're doing here is enacting
the idea, the feeling, expressed in "ホッ", the sigh of
relief.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Just as in " 山に のぼろう と する" we're
enacting the feeling, the import of setting our will toward
climbing the mountain, that is, trying to climb it.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Now, similarly, if we say "Sakuraを
日本人とする", it means regarding Sakura as a Japanese person.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span style=
"overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 624.00px; height: 350.67px;">

title=""></span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Now, we might also say, "Sakuraを
日本人にする", but that means something quite different.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">It means "turn Sakura into a
Japanese person".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">に is the target of an
action.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">A little while ago we had a lesson
in which we talked about "さくらが カエルになる" - "Sakura becomes a
frog".</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Now, we've also talked about the way
that "ある" and "する" are the Eve and Adam of Japanese verbs, "ある"
being the primary self-move verb and "する" the primary other-move
verb.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"なる" is very closely related to "ある"
- "ある" is "be", "なる" is "become".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And so if we say "になる" it means to
become something.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">If we say "にする" that's the
other-move version of "になる".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">It means to "turn something into
something".</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span style=

title=""></span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So if we say, "majoが Sakura を kaeruに
shita" - "the witch turned Sakura into a frog".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Sakura を 日本人に する"- turning Sakura
into a Japanese person; but "Sakura を 日本人 と する"- regarding Sakura
as a Japanese person / taking Sakura as a Japanese
person.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"かばん を makura と する.""かばん"is "bag",
"makura"is "pillow" and this means "using your bag as a
pillow".</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span style=
"overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 624.00px; height: 350.67px;">

title=""></span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">You're not turning your bag into a
pillow, it's not becoming a pillow, but you're regarding it as one
and using it as one.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So here we have some of the uses of
"とする".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Generally speaking, it relates to
how we regard something.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Now, if we say "として", this isn't so
much the act of regarding something as something, but seeing
something in the light of being something.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So, in English it would usually be
translated simply as "as".</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span style=
"overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 624.00px; height: 350.67px;">

title=""></span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So, "個人としての意見" means "my opinion as
a private person", as opposed to, say, my opinion as president of
the Frog Jockey Society.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Or we could say, "アメリカ人として小さい" -
"She's small for an American / As an American, she's
small.</span></p>
<h2 class="c22" id="h.24a9gwt570nm"><span class=
"c16">という</span></h2>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So we can see that the quotation
function of と is used not only to quote ideas and thoughts, but
also to take the feeling of something and bundle it up and then say
something about it.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Of course, the most basic thing that
can follow と is 言う, in which case it's a literal quotation, という
(it's usually pronounced not so much "という" as "とゆ").</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And this again can be used not just
in a literal quotation but also saying how something is said or
what it's called.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span style=
"overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 624.00px; height: 350.67px;">

title=""></span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So, "不思議の国のアリスという本", means "book
called 不思議の国のアリス".</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And the と in "という"can be reduced
simply to って.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So we can say "っていう" -
"不思議の国のアリスっていう本", or it can be reduced down to just って.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span style=
"overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 624.00px; height: 350.67px;">

title=""></span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"不思議の国のアリスって本" still means "the book
called Alice in Wonderland".</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So people sometimes get a little
confused when they just see this って.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">It means と or という, but the thing
that really confuses people sometimes is that it can also be used
in place of the は particle.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Now, this seems particularly
strange, until you realize what it's actually doing.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">If we remember what the は particle
is, the は particle is the topic-marking particle.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So when we say "Sakuraは日本人だ" , we
can put that into English as "Speaking of Sakura, she is Japanese
person".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Now, does that start to make things
a little clearer?</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Sakuraって日本人だ" - "Sakura-say, she
Japanese-person is"</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Sakura-speaking of, she
Japanese-person is" - "Sakura (topic), she Japanese-person
is".</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span style=

title=""></span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Now, we can't say と or という in place
of the は particle.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">It's a very casual use.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">We just use って.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">But you can see that it's really,
even though it's very colloquial, it's not just some random and
inexplicable thing.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">It's setting up Sakura as the thing
we're talking about, just as は is.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Now, there are other extended uses
of と .</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">We'll cover those as we come to
them.</span></p>

Lesson 19: Causative + "causative passive": what they NEVER tell
you! It's logical and super easy</a></span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">こんにちは.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Today we are going to talk about the
causative helper verb.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">In the standard grammars this is
called "causative" and it's a perfectly good name because it
indicates that we are causing someone to do the verb to which it is
attached.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">In the standard grammars it's often
taught along with the receptive (which they like to call the
"passive") and there's a very very good reason for doing this
although the real reason is never actually explained in the regular
textbooks.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So, I'll be telling you that
shortly.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">But first of all let's look at what
the causative helper verb is.</span></p>
<h2 class="c22" id="h.ty8h7544edal"><span class="c16">Causative
Helper Verb</span></h2>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">It's a helper verb which, like the
receptive, goes onto the end of the a-stem of another verb, and
while the receptive helper is "れる/られる", the causative helper is
"せる/させる".</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span style=
"overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 624.00px; height: 350.67px;">

title=""></span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">If they sound rather close to each
other, there's a good reason for that.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">As we have noted earlier, the Eve
and Adam of Japanese verbs are "ある" and "する" – "be" and
"do".</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span style=
"overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 624.00px; height: 350.67px;">

title=""></span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"ある" is the mother of all self-move
verbs; "する" is the father of all other-move verbs.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Now, the receptive "れる/られる" is
closely related to "ある"; the causative "せる/させる" is closely related
to "する".</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And while it's not exact to say that
they are the self-move and other-move versions of each other, we
can see that they are very closely related conceptually to
that.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"れる/られる" indicates receiving the
action to which it is attached.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"せる/させる" means causing that action
to be performed by somebody else.</span></p>
<h2 class="c22" id="h.c03z0dc3a41r"><span class="c16">Helper Verbs
are not conjugation</span></h2>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And this leads on to the most
fundamental similarity between the two pairs of helper verbs – the
similarity that the textbooks never explain and that is most
fundamental to understanding how they work.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Why don't the textbooks explain it?
Well, the fundamental reason is that they call the causative and
the receptive helper verbs "conjugations".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And the real structure of how they
work is completely destroyed and obscured by calling them
"conjugations".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">A conjugated verb is by definition a
single verb.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">But a verb plus the receptive or the
causative helper is never a single verb.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">It's two verbs.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span style=

title=""></span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Not only is it two verbs, but the
two verbs always have two separate subjects.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So in a sentence like "水が 犬に 飲まれた" –
"the water got drunk by the dog"– we have two verbs, two actions,
and two different actors doing the two different verbs.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span style=
"overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 624.00px; height: 350.67px;">

title=""></span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">The main verb of the sentence, the
core verb, is "れる" – "get"– and that's being done by the water: the
water is getting drunk by the dog.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">The secondary verb is "drink" and
that's being done by the dog.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">This becomes clearer in a slightly
longer sentence:</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"さくらが 誰かに かばんを ぬすまれた" – "Sakura got
her bag stolen by someone".</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span style=
"overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 624.00px; height: 350.67px;">

title=""></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Again, there are two actions going
on, and always in a receptive sentence the main action, the core
action of the sentence, is "れる" – "receive": "Sakura
received".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span>But there is a nested action within this done
by the secondary verb, "</span><span>ぬすむ</span><span class="c1">" –
"steal".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And that's done by
"someone".</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Now, it's exactly the same with the
causative.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">We always have two actors performing
the two different verbs.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So if we say, "犬を 食べさせた", which
means "I caused the dog to eat", there are two actions going
on.</span></p>

<p class="c0"><span class="c1">There is the action of eating, which
is being done by the dog, and then there is the main action, the
core action of the sentence, the action of causing, which is done
by me.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So as you see, we cannot possibly
talk about a conjugated verb in the case of either the receptive or
the causative helper.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">In each case, there are two separate
verbs.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Even though they're joined together,
they not only remain separate in function but they refer to two
different actors.</span></p>
<h2 class="c22" id="h.yipua9ocs2jj"><span class="c16">Make or allow
?</span></h2>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Now let's also take a moment to
understand what "せる/させる" actually means.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">We're told that in English it can
mean either "make"someone do something or "allow" someone to do
something.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And that's correct: it can have
either of those meanings.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">But the important thing to
understand is that it can have either of those meanings but it can
also have neither of those meanings.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">The best way to translate it is with
the very un-English sounding "cause" someone to do
something.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Why? Because we can mean that we're
forcing them to do something, we can mean that we are allowing them
to do something, but we can also mean something that isn't covered
by either of those English translations.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">An example? Well, you've already had
one: "犬を 食べさせた."It doesn't mean "I forced the dog to eat", does it?
But it also doesn't mean "I allowed the dog to eat".</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span style=
"overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 624.00px; height: 350.67px;">

title=""></span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">It doesn't mean that I gave the dog
permission to eat or I took it off its chain so it could reach the
food.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">That's not what it means.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">It means that I set up the
conditions under which it was able to eat; I gave it food; I caused
it to eat.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So "せる/させる" means "cause" a person
or a thing to perform an action by whatever means, whether that
causing is allowing, whether it's compelling or whether it's
setting up the conditions to make it happen.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<h2 class="c22" id="h.ius4x030pics"><span class="c16">を or に
?</span></h2>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Now, the only thing that can appear
to be a little confusing about the causative is that sometimes the
person or thing that we are causing to do something can be marked
by を and sometimes by に.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Now, I've told you before that
Japanese particles do not change their function at random, as the
textbooks strongly imply and sometimes openly state that they do –
and as we have to believe if we think that "コーヒーが 好き だ" literally
means "I like coffee".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And if you don't know what I'm
talking about here, please watch the relevant video, because this
is absolutely crucial to understanding Japanese
correctly.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So how is it that two different
logical particles can apply to the thing or person we are causing
to do something? That is to say, the noun associated with
"せる/させる".</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span style=
"overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 624.00px; height: 350.67px;">

title=""></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">First of all, we have to understand
that this thing can be seen as either the object or the target of
the action ("せる/させる") of the person or thing that is doing the
causing.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">If we take that object or target to
be human, it becomes a little clearer.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">If we treat the person as the
object, we are assuming that they have no personal will in the
matter; we are treating them literally as an object.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So this is more appropriate when we
are compelling someone to do something; if we treat them as a
target, the implication is more mutual, we are treating them more
as an equal and this goes more naturally with allowing rather than
compelling.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And I've talked about these degrees
of mutuality between the particles を, に and と when dealing with
people in a video which you may want to watch.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span>However,</span><span>&nbsp;the choice between に
and を is not the main, or an exact</span><span>,
indicator</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;of whether we mean allowing
or compelling when we use "せる/させる".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Why not? There are two reasons for
this.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">The first, as we've already
mentioned, is that saying that "せる/させる" either means "compel" or
"allow" is warping the meaning of the causative by trying to find
exact English analogies, and there is no precise English
analogy.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">On many occasions, as I
demonstrated, it may mean neither "compel" nor "allow".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">It's a sliding scale between the
two; it's subtler and more graduated than that.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Secondly, when the action that is
being compelled itself has a を-marked object – for example, "犬に 肉を
食べさせた" – "I caused the dog to eat meat".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span style=
"overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 624.00px; height: 350.67px;">
<img alt="" src="images/image308.jpg" style=
"width: 624.00px; height: 350.67px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);"
title=""></span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">You can see the implied, subordinate
sentence here is "犬が 肉を 食べた".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">The meat is the object of the dog's
action, and the dog is the thing I am causing to do that
action.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Now, in these kinds of sentences,
Japanese does not allow us to use the を particle twice.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Since there is an を particle
attached to the meat which is being eaten by the dog – in other
words, that's the object of the inner, subordinate sentence – we
can't also use it on the dog itself who is the object or target of
the causing.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Why is that? Well, really this is
partly stylistic, but largely a pragmatic strategy on the part of
Japanese grammar.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Not only does it sound awkward if
you have two をs in the sentence, it could, in some sentences,
become ambiguous.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">We might end up with some doubt as
to which を marked the object associated with "食べる" (or whatever the
verb is) and which を is associated with "せる/させる", the causing of
the action.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">As it is, we always know that in a
"せる/させる" sentence, a causative sentence, which also has an object
of the action itself, that object will always be marked by を, and
the target or object of the causation, the thing be made to do
something or allowed to do something or facilitated in doing
something, will be marked by に.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Well, that I think is the most
complicated aspect of the whole thing, and it's not really very
difficult, is it?</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<h2 class="c22" id="h.681yh9vjs2ez"><span class="c16">Causative
Receptive</span></h2>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Now, the other thing that people do
find particularly difficult is the causative receptive (what is
called the "causative passive" and, when taught with the standard
grammatical model, causes people to receive a great deal of
confusion).</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Now, as a matter of fact, once we
have understood what the causative and the receptive really are and
really do, I don't think there's anything special about the
causative receptive at all.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">We know that helper verbs are simply
verbs.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">They attach to other verbs, but they
are verbs in their own right.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">If we don't understand this,
everything becomes very difficult.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Now also, the main structural helper
verbs, like the causative, the potential and the receptive, are
ichidan verbs.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So if we need to attach anything
else to them, we simply do what we do with every other ichidan verb
– we take off the る and attach whatever it is we're going to
attach.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So if we want to attach the
receptive to the causative, we simply take the る off the causative,
"せる" or "させる", and attach "られる", which is the ichidan helper form
of the receptive.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And it's as simple as
that.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span style=
"overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 624.00px; height: 350.67px;">

title=""></span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Nothing complicated about it at
all.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">But somebody's going to say, quite
rightly, "but don't we have three verbs in the sentence now?" and
that's exactly right.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">We have three verbs in a causative
receptive sentence.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">For example, "私は ブロッコリーを 食べさせられた" –
"I got made to eat broccoli".</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span style=
"overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 624.00px; height: 350.67px;">
<img alt="" src="images/image99.jpg" style=
"width: 624.00px; height: 350.67px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);"
title=""></span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So we have three verbs: "食べる" –
"eat" ; "させる" – "compel" (in this case it will be "compel"); "られる"
– "receive":</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span>"I</span> <span>received
being</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;compelled to eat
broccoli".</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So, if we have three verbs, do we
have three subjects? No, we have two subjects.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">There are always two
subjects.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And is it difficult to understand
what the two subjects are going to be? No, it isn't, because the
person receiving and the person eating are always going to be the
same.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"I received being made to eat..."– I
was the one that received being made to eat, and therefore, I must
have been also the one that ate.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So the first verb in the sentence,
the verb to which the other two are attached, is always going to be
performed by the same person as the last verb, the
receiving.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And the compelling of the person to
do something is always done by someone else.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So we have three verbs, two of which
are attached to the person who received the compulsion and who did
the action because she received the compulsion.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And the middle one belongs to the
person who did the compulsion.</span></p>

Lesson 20: &nbsp;"Sore/Sono/Sonna/Sou" etc. how directional words
REALLY work!"</a></span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">こんにちは.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Today we're going to talk about the
Japanese system of directional words which use ko-, so-, a-,
do-.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">This is commonly called the
ko-so-a-do system and initially it simply marks physical locations,
but it then expands out to more subtle and metaphorical
uses.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span style=
"overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 624.00px; height: 350.67px;">

title=""></span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">This is common because all languages
use physical metaphors to express abstract concepts.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And fortunately these means of
expression are often similar across languages because the
conceptual world maps to the physical world in certain quite
predictable ways.</span></p>
<h2 class="c22" id="h.bw6puin2ft78"><span class="c16">ここ そこ あそこ
どこ</span></h2>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So let's take the most basic meaning
and use of ko-so-a-do, and that is actual physical
locations.</span></p>
<p class="c19 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">The most basic location use is ここ,
そこ, あそこ, どこ.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span style=

title=""></span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">ここ means " here".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">If you know the Japanese word 心,
"heart"- it's here, right where I am, right where my heart
is.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">That's not the etymology of the
word, but it's a mnemonic.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"そこ" means "there".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Now, often ここ means the speaker's
place and "そこ" means the place of the listener.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"あそこ" means "over there" and it
often means distant from both the speaker and the
listener.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So the あ -word means over there,
somewhat in the distance, so it's a bit far away, you have to aaaah
- shout - to be heard over there.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">“どこ” means "where", so that's a
question word.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<ul class="c13 lst-kix_a9br1s7eb4ba-0 start">
<li class="c17 c30 li-bullet-0"><span class="c1">So, こ-words mean
here, possibly near to me</span></li>
<li class="c17 c30 li-bullet-0"><span class="c1">the そ-words mean
there, often near to you</span></li>
<li class="c17 c30 li-bullet-0"><span class="c1">the あ -words mean
over there</span></li>
<li class="c17 c30 li-bullet-0"><span class="c1">and the ど-words
form a question.</span></li>
</ul>
<p class="c2 c19"></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So, in anime or manga you'll often
see someone saying, "ここはどこ?" - "where is this?"</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Literally, "Speaking of this place,
where is it?" and that seems to be the most usual way for a
Japanese person to ask that question finding herself suddenly in an
unknown location.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">The English way of asking it is more
likely to be ---- "where am I?" but the Japanese way is "where is
this place?"</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"ここはどこ" - "as for this place,
where?"</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Now, that's quite simple, I
think.</span></p>
<h2 class="c22" id="h.vfrgmoxbu9jb"><span class="c16">これ それ あれ
どれ</span></h2>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And now we're going to look at
something that does occasionally confuse people, and that's because
when we come to the re- and the no-group, in English we express
both with the same word.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">But we do have the distinction, so
let's look at those.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">The re-group is これ それ あれ
どれ.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>

title=""></span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And the thing here is that the -re
means "a thing".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Ko means a place, a location, and it
can actually be written with the kanji for "とこと" -
"place".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">-Re is related to "ある".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">It's one of these things that's
related to the fundamental "ある", the mother of verbs.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And "ある" means to "be"; this -re
means "a being".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">When we say "a being" in English we
usually mean a sentient being, an animal or a person or something,
but this means any kind of a being, anything that
exists.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<ul class="c13 lst-kix_t09qykrgsiry-0 start">
<li class="c17 c30 li-bullet-0"><span class="c1">So, これ means "this

<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Now, -re means a being and refers to
a thing.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">-No, as we know, is used to make
adjectivals or descriptors.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So if we say, "Sakuraのドレス", we're
saying, "Sakura's dress".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">If we say, "伝説の戦士", we're saying,
"legendary warrior / warrior that belongs to the class of
legend".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Now, this is the same の that we see
in "この / その / あの / どの".</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So if we take a very basic textbook
phrase like "これはペンだ" , we're saying, "this - this being - is a
pen."</span></p>

<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Now, in English we can say "this" or
"this pen" and there's no distinction between the words.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">We're using "this" in both
cases.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>

<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Now, in this case we are using
-na.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And -na, as we know, is the form of
the copula that turns an adjectival noun into an adjective that you
can place before something else.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And this is exactly what's happening
here.</span></p>
<ul class="c13 lst-kix_4s3mobp4qvde-0 start">
<li class="c17 c30 li-bullet-0"><span class="c1">So, こんな means

<li class="c17 c30 li-bullet-0"><span class="c1">そんな means "that

<li class="c17 c30 li-bullet-0"><span class="c1">あんな means "that

</ul>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And I'm not going to go into the
details of this, but whether we use "そんな" or "あんな" is going to
depend on... sometimes the literal position of something but very
often on how far these things are from what we are talking about,
from the present circumstance, from something we associate with
ourselves.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So, we could say, "こんな食べ物が 好き です" -
"I like food like this".</span></p>

<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"そんな ことが ひどい" - "that kind of

title=""></span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And in fact you'll often find in
anime or manga that someone just says, "そんな!"</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And when it's said in that kind of a
complaining or accusing kind of way, it's short for saying "that
kind of thing."</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">You're saying, "that kind of thing",
and it would mean something like "that kind of thing is unkind/
that kind of thing is mean/ that kind of thing is something I don't
like."</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"そんな!" - "that you said such a
thing!"</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So "そんな" is essentially a comparing
adjectival: we're describing what something is like by comparing it
to something else that we're referring to, something that's here,
something that's over there or something that's way over there,
either in physical space or conceptually.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<ul class="c13 lst-kix_r635ywa0mf4y-0 start">
<li class="c17 c30 li-bullet-0"><span class="c1">どんな is asking what

<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Literally, what would we compare it
to?</span></p>
<h2 class="c22" id="h.z1gbkpcupnzs"><span class="c16">こう そう ああ
どう</span></h2>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Now, when we use ko-so-a-do on their
own and lengthen them with う (or in the case of a-, with an extra
-a) so they become こう そう ああ どう, then we are talking about the way
something is or happens.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>

<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So when we say "そうですね?" we're

<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span style=

<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So what we are really saying is "そうだ

<p class="c0"><span class="c1">If we say, "そうする" we mean "do like
that"; if we say "こうする" we mean "do like this": do in that way / do
in this way.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">If we say "どうする", we say "do like
how?" and we often say "どうすればいい?"</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>

<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Now, "すれば" is the conditional form
of "する".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Saying "どう すれば いい?" means "how if I

<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And we often find these combined

<p class="c0"><span class="c1">It's another example of the wider
application of the concept of quotation in Japanese, which we
discussed recently.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And this is often used in relation
to things that are not physical, concrete things - in other words,
the kind of things which we call "こと" rather than "もの".</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span style=

<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And we're going to hear an awful lot
"そういうこと", "こういうこと" and "どういうこと".</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">We also hear "ああいうこと". It's less
commonly used than the others, but it is used.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So what do we mean when we
say:</span></p>
<ul class="c13 lst-kix_e9bu3ityhc53-0 start">
<li class="c17 c30 li-bullet-0"><span class="c1">"そういうこと" - "a
thing of that kind" ;</span></li>
<li class="c17 c30 li-bullet-0"><span class="c1">"こういうこと" - "a
thing of this kind" ;</span></li>
<li class="c17 c30 li-bullet-0"><span class="c1">"どういうこと" - "what
kind of a thing"?</span></li>
</ul>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Why do we mean "what kind of a
thing"? This kind of a thing/that kind of thing, what kind of a
thing? What we're actually saying is " how-said thing/ how-said
circumstance/ how-said condition".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">In other words, in what way do we
describe this condition/ what kind of a description does this
circumstance or condition have?</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And we often hear as a kind of
exclamation, "どういうこと!?" and it means "what's going on here? / what
is this? / what description of thing is this that's
happening?"</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And it can also mean "what are you
talking about/what are you getting at/ what are you saying
here?"</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">“どういうこと!?" and the thing to
understand here is that the 言う there is not referring to the fact
that the person has just said it.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"どういうこと" meaning "what do you mean/
what are you driving at/ what are you talking about here?" the 言う
is not referring to the fact that you're saying it.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">The 言う refers to the description of
the thing.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So "どういうこと" is in this case short
for "どういうことをいう?" - " how described thing are you
saying?"</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span>So we see the ko-so-a-do system works both in
terms of literal location and in terms of metaphorical
location.</span></p>

Alice's adventures, and we're going to use them as an opportunity
to look into some of the deeper and more subtle uses of the
て-form.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">These are covered in the regular
textbooks and Japanese learning websites, but as usual they don't
explain the logic behind them, which makes them more difficult to
grasp.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And in some cases where there isn't
a straightforward English equivalent they really don't tell you
what's actually going on, because they only talk in terms of
English equivalents, which leaves you guessing quite a bit of the

<ul class="c13 lst-kix_nubrfvwcv3ee-0 start">
<li class="c17 c30 li-bullet-0"><span class="c1">" 貼る" means

<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">What about "てある"?</span></p>

<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">First of all, we are using the
other-move version of "開く", which is "開ける".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"窓が 開いている"– that's the self-move
version of "開く" and it simply means to be open, to exist in a state
of openness.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">The other-move verb, "開ける", which is
the regular く / ける u-ending verb to e-stem plus る of the third law
of self-move/other-move verbs that we've looked at
already.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So "開く" means be open.Yourself,
whatever you are, a box or whatever.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"開ける" means open the box, open the
door etc.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So what "窓が 開けてある" means is that the
window was open, but it was open because somebody else opened
it.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">We're signaling that in the first
place by using the other-move version of the verb and in the second
place by using "ある" instead of "いる".</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So what's the reasoning behind
that?</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Well, when we say "窓が 開いている",
although it is an inanimate object, we're using the version of "be"
which we use for animate beings, people and animals and
such.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">That in fact is the part that needs
explaining, isn't it?</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Why are we using the animate version
of "be" for an inanimate object like a window?</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And we do this all the
time.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">We're always saying "ている" for
inanimate objects of all kinds.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">The reason is that in this
expression we're simply saying the window was open – we're not
implying that anybody opened the window.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So, in a way, we can say that we're
treating the window as an honorary animate being.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">The window was open, as it were, of
its own volition.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">We're not saying it's open because
of anybody's will other than its own.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So in a certain sense we are
treating the window as an honorary animate being: "窓が
開いている".</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">But if we say "窓が 開けてある", we are
saying that somebody opened the window.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">The window was the mere object of
having been opened by somebody else.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So it loses its status as an
honorary animate being.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">It is treated as a mere object, an
inanimate thing – "開けてある".</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And the thing to understand here is
that even though it's lost its status as an animate being, even
though we're using the other-move version of the verb, the が marked
actor of this sentence is the window: "窓が 開けてある".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">The window is doing the action,
which is "ある": the window is existing in a state of having been
opened by somebody else.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And that is the same thing that's
happening in our sentence from Alice.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span style=

it."</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Now, as you see, there is really
nothing equivalent to this in English, so we just need to get it
into our minds so that we can look at the Japanese as
Japanese.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">This is fundamental to what I'm
teaching here.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">I'm teaching the real structure of
Japanese, not simply throwing some Japanese at you and throwing
some English at you and saying, "well, this kind of means that." we
need to get rid of English translation as far as possible and look
at the Japanese as it really works in itself as
Japanese.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And that's why my "translations"
under the trains get weirder and weirder.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Because I'm not trying to translate
this for you into natural English.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">I'm trying to tell you what the
Japanese is really doing.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So the second half of the
sentence…</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span style=

title=""></span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">The second て-form, of course, is
simply joining the first logical clause in this compound sentence
to the second logical clause.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And the second logical clause is
「オレンジ・ママレード」と 書いて あった.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And here we have again this "てある"
form.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And whenever we talk about something
being written on something we tend to use this form.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">We don't say "the label said “Orange
Marmalade''', which is what we say in English, as if the label
could speak. We say 「オレンジ・ママレード」と 書いて あった".</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;と is our quotation particle,
of course, that's quoting exactly what was written on the label,
and then "書いて あった" means that it was in a state of having had those
words written on it by somebody else.</span></p>
<h2 class="c22" id="h.86snxdnl35tf"><span class=
"c16">ておく</span></h2>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Now, I'm going to do something a
tiny bit unusual here. I hope you won't mind.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">I'm going to skip ahead just a
little bit in the story, because the next part contains a very
interesting point that really needs a lesson of its own, and the
part immediately after that includes something that really rounds
out what we're doing today.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">It introduces "ておく", which really
belongs together with "ている" and "てある".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">This relationship is something the
textbooks don't explain and because they don't it leaves "ておく"
rather undefined in people's minds.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Many quite advanced students don't
really understand why "ておく" is used in some cases.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So we'll go ahead with that now and
I'll just fill you in on the story in between.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">It's only a little bit.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Alice realizes that the marmalade
jar is in fact empty, and what's she going to do with it? She
doesn't want to drop it because it'll fall all the way down the
hole and very likely kill someone.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And, if you read the newspapers,
you're probably aware that there are far too many empty marmalade
jar incidents in Wonderland already.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So, now you know the background,
let's carry on.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"うまく 戸棚の 一つへ 通りすがりに 置いて
おいた."</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span style=

title=""></span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<ul class="c13 lst-kix_arnf5baj5my6-0 start">
<li class="c17 c30 li-bullet-0"><span class="c1">"うまく" means
"skilfully"</span></li>
<li class="c17 c30 li-bullet-0"><span class="c1">"戸棚" as we know is
a "cupboard"</span></li>
<li class="c17 c30 li-bullet-0"><span class="c1">"戸棚の 一つ", as we
talked about in the last lesson, is "one of the
cupboards"</span></li>
</ul>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So she skilfully in passing put it
into one of the cupboards.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And what's this "置いて
おいた"?</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Now, they're both the same "置く",
"置く"meaning to "put".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">The first one is simple enough: she
"put" it into the cupboard, but why do we have the second "置く" on
the end of it – "置いて おいた"?</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Now, this is another very common and
very important て-form usage and it's one that textbooks and
English-language websites tend not to explain very well, because
it's something we really don't have in English.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">However, we already halfway know it,
because it is in a certain sense the other half of
"てある".</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"ておく" means to put the action in
place.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Now in this particular use, it's
quite easy to see because she's putting the jar literally into
place and she's putting that action into place.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">What the textbooks and websites tell
you is that it means doing something in advance, doing something
for the purpose of something else.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And this is true in many
cases.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">It's probably the nearest you can
get in English.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">But what it actually means is
putting the action in place.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And to understand this let's go back
to our example "窓が 開けてある" – "the window is open because somebody
opened it".</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span style=
"overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 624.00px; height: 350.67px;">
<img alt="" src="images/image275.jpg" style=

title=""></span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Now, the somebody who opened it, if
we say it instead of from the point of view of the window, from the
point of view of the person doing the action, "開けておく" is the other
side of this.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">The person put the opening of the
window into place so that thereafter the window would be
open.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So you see we have the two halves of
the same coin.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"窓が開けてある"– the window stands open
because somebody put it there.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"窓を開けておく"– open a window so that it
will stand open for the future, so that it will then be open, put
into place the action of opening the window.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And this is what "置く" means – "oku"
means "place".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So you're "placing" the action,
you're putting it into place, you're setting it up.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And that's why it tends to have the
secondary meaning of "do in advance" or "do for another purpose",
because you are setting up that action and the implication is that
you want the effect of that action to "remain in place" for
whatever future purposes it may have.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">In this case, Alice does not have a
future purpose.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So in fact, て-form plus "置く" has a
much wider range of meaning than the "do in advance" or "do for a
purpose" kind of English translation that it gets in the
textbooks.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">In the case of Alice in this story,
she isn't really doing anything in advance or for a purpose; she's
simply trying to solve the problem of what to do with the empty
marmalade jar without risking injuring the people below.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And there are many cases when this
usage falls even further from the English-language
definitions.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">For example, people say, "It's cruel
to lock a small child in her room", and for this we use
閉じ込めておく.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"閉じ組める" is "shut someone up/lock
someone away" and the "ておく" here doesn't mean do it for a purpose,
it doesn't mean do it in advance.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">It means do the action and leave its
results in place/put the action in place and leave it in
effect</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Similarly, people say, "It's all
right to leave a baby to cry sometimes" – "泣かせておく".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"泣く" is "cry" ; "泣かせる" is the
causative of cry: "allow to cry"in this case.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And the "ておく" doesn't mean do it in
advance or do it for some special purpose.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span>It simply means do the action and leave its
effects in place/put the action in place.</span></p>

<ul class="c13 lst-kix_lnosh8hoht86-0 start">
<li class="c17 c30 li-bullet-0"><span class="c1">空 means "empty",
and you can see it has the kanji for "sky", which I guess is the
biggest empty space in this world.</span></li>
</ul>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">から– "empty"– is the から in "空手",
which is the art of fighting with empty hand, without any
weapon.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"空っぽ" is a kind of strengthening of
"empty", meaning there was nothing in it, it was completely
empty.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And "空っぽ" works as a noun, and
generally speaking if you don't know what kind of word a word is in
Japanese, it's most likely to be a noun.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Japanese is quite a noun-centered
language, because all the words that come in from other languages
like Chinese, of which there are a huge amount, and English, and
other languages too come in as nouns.</span></p>

<p class="c0"><span>"空っぽの びんでも、下へ 落として</span><span>は

<ul class="c13 lst-kix_rz81k35ou85h-0 start">
<li class="c17 c30 li-bullet-0"><span class="c1">"落とす" means to
"drop".</span></li>
</ul>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">It's another one of our
self-move/other-move pairs.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"落ちる" means to "fall"– that's
self-move: a thing falls, by itself.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"落とす", which ends in す, according to
the first law of self-move/other-move verbs, so it means "drop": we
don't drop ourselves, we drop something else.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<ul class="c13 lst-kix_7tnvm5afebrq-0 start">
<li class="c17 c30 li-bullet-0"><span class="c1">"下へ": now, へ, as
we know, is the other targeting particle.</span></li>
</ul>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">It's very similar to に, but the
difference is that へ tends to refer more to the direction something
is moving than to its actual target.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So in this particular case, "したに
落とす" wouldn't be right.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">We're not saying that we're dropping
it to a particular target, like "テーブルの下"– the under of the
table/under the table.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">We're just dropping it downwards,
dropping it in a downward direction.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">We don't even know what's down
there.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">She did try looking and she couldn't
see much.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So dropping it in the direction of
down – "下へ 落とす".</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span>Now, "下へ 落として</span><span>は
悪い</span><span class="c1">".</span></p>
<ul class="c13 lst-kix_grtvwjb5s5ma-0 start">
<li class="c17 c30 li-bullet-0"><span class="c1">Now here you see,
we've just had て-form plus も; now we have て-form plus は
.</span></li>
</ul>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And we know that も and は are the
opposite twins.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">While も is the additive, including
particle, は is the subtractive, excluding particle.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So, while ても means "as much as", ては
means "as little as".</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Now, we tend to use ても in positive
contexts – "If I do as much as this, will it be all
right?"</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">But we use ては in negative,
forbidding contexts – "don't even do as little as that".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So we often say, "てはダメ" – "do that
is no good/do that is bad".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">In this case, it's very similar:
"落としては悪い" – "even as little as dropping it would be
bad".</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">The point isn't really that dropping
it is a small thing, or that eating the cake is a big
thing.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">The point is that we can go as far
as eating the cake, that's fine, but don't even think about
dropping it: "落としては悪い"– doing that is right out of the
question.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Very often this forbidding ては is
just contracted to ちゃ.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span style=

title=""></span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Now this pattern continues into
other uses of ては .</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">For example, we can use ては as a
connector between two clauses and it implies that the second clause
is unwanted or negative.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span style=
"overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 624.00px; height: 350.67px;">

title=""></span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So we can say, "雨が降っては公園に行けない" –
"It's raining and we can't go to the park".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Now, as we know, て can connect two
sentences and if we just said, "雨が降って公園に行けない" we're saying – "It's
raining and we can't go to the park".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">There's an implication that we can't
go to the park because it's raining but there's no suggestion of
whether we're happy or unhappy with the result.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"雨が降っては公園に行けない" is indicating that
the result is unpleasant or unwanted.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And you can see that this does have
its root in the restrictive quality of は .</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">For example, in English we might
say, "Just because it's raining, we can't go to the park" and this
is exactly what は means, doesn't it?</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">If we say "パンを食べた", we're saying "I
ate bread", but if we say, "パンは食べた" that often implies I ate bread
but I didn't eat something else.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Conversely, if we say, "パンを食べなかった",
we're saying "I didn't eat bread"; if we say "パンは食べなかった", we're
often implying I didn't eat bread, but I did eat something
else.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"雨が降っては公園に行けない" originally could
imply something like "Just because it's raining, we can't go to the
park", but now its implication is more "Unfortunately, because it's
raining, we can't go to the park".</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"妹と喧嘩しては母に叱られた" – "because I
quarrelled with my sister, I got scolded..."</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span style=
"overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 624.00px; height: 350.67px;">

title=""></span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And again, the は in there indicates
that this is a negative result.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So it links two complete clauses
with the indication that the second one follows as an unfortunate
result from the first one.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So this is a continuation of the
negative implication of ては .</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<h2 class="c22" id="h.mi8oxc1j4qaq"><span class=
"c16">ても</span></h2>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">て も, on the other hand, when it
links two sentences, doesn't indicate a negative result or a
positive result.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">It indicates an unexpected or
contrasting result to the first.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So if we said, "雨が降っても公園に 行く", we're
saying "Even though it is raining, we're going to the
park".</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span style=
"overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 624.00px; height: 350.67px;">

title=""></span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And you can see that this is
essentially the same function as "でも" , which gets translated as
"but", quite correctly.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"でも" folds up whatever went before
it into that "で", which is the て-form of "だ".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So we're saying "that all happened"
and the も then adds to it the "but" element, the "even though", "as
much as" element.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So we could also say, "雨が降るでも公園に行く",
which means almost exactly the same as "雨が降っても公園に行く".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">The difference structurally is that
in "雨が降っても", the て-mo only attaches to "降る", whereas in "が降るでも” the
で is wrapping up the whole of the last sentence.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">In practice that gives us pretty
much the same meaning.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So let's just go back to that
sentence in Alice and see how it's structured.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">It's a little more complex than it
looks at first, but it's very easy to understand.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And if we can understand it, it
gives us the key to analyzing much more complex sentences which
could give us trouble in the future.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span style=
"overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 624.00px; height: 350.67px;">

title=""></span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">The core of the sentence is at the
beginning and the end.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">The whole sentence is just telling
us what Alice thought.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So the core is "(アリスは ) zeroが
思った".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">The inside of the sentence consists
of two topic-comment structures.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">The first topic is "even though it's
an empty bottle" (topic) and the comment on that is itself another
topic-comment structure: "as for dropping it, that would be
bad".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And then the whole of this double
topic-comment structure is bundled up into that と , which really
means we can treat the whole thing as a kind of quasi-noun – just
bundle up into that と and attribute it to Alice as her
thought.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Now, of course, as we're actually
reading or looking at Japanese we don't think of "as for" or
"speaking of" every time we see a topic-comment statement, because
"as for" in English is much weightier, much more cumbersome than
the simple は and も in Japanese.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So what do we do? Once again, as
always, we don't translate it into English except when we
absolutely need to, to explain it or understand it.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">We take the Japanese as it is in
itself, and that's how we learn Japanese as opposed to just
learning about Japanese.</span></p>

<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">こんにちは.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Today we're going to talk about
"だって" and some of the issues that raises about the use of "だ" and
"です".</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">One of my commenters spoke about
being confused by the "word" "だって" and I'm not surprised, because
if you look at the Japanese-English dictionaries they tell you that
"だって" means "because" and "but" and "even" and also "somebody
said", which is quite a confusing pile of meanings for one
so-called word.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And I say "so-called" word because
"だって" isn't really even a word.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And the thing that never seems to
get explained in dictionaries or anywhere else is what it really
is, what it actually means, and therefore why it carries the range
of meanings that it does.</span></p>
<h2 class="c22" id="h.jdlk05vg9t38"><span class="c16">だって -
Somebody said</span></h2>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So, let's start off with the most
basic meaning, which is the last one on the list, "somebody
said".</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"だって" is actually simply made up of
the copula "だ" plus って, which is not the て-form of anything, it's
the -って which is a contraction, as we've talked about before, of
the quotation particle と plus 言う.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span style=
"overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 624.00px; height: 350.67px;">

title=""></span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So って means "という", in other words,
"says" a particular thing.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">The と bundles up something into a
quotation and the 言う says that somebody says it.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So it's really as simple as
that.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"明日は晴れだって" is simply
"明日が晴れ..."</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span style=
"overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 624.00px; height: 350.67px;">
<img alt="" src="images/image362.jpg" style=
"width: 624.00px; height: 350.67px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);"
title=""></span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"晴れ" means "sunny" or "clear skies"–
and as with most words where there's some doubt of what kind of
word they are, they usually turn out to be nouns, "晴れ" is a
noun.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So, "明日は晴れだ" simply means "tomorrow
will be sunny".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And when we add って, we're saying,
"It's said that tomorrow will be fine".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">We might be saying that someone in
particular says it or we may just be saying "it's said" in general
– "I hear tomorrow will be fine", we might say in
English.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"They say tomorrow will be
fine."</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So that's very simple, and that's
what "だって" is: it's "だ" plus って, the "という" contraction.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And that's what it is in all the
other cases too, so let's see how it works.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<h2 class="c22" id="h.sxxl9njazu1a"><span class="c16">だって -
But</span></h2>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">How does it come to mean
"but"?</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Well, to begin with let's understand
that when it's used on its own – and it means "but" when it's used
on its own, not as the ending of a sentence as in the example we
just looked at – it has a slightly childish and usually somewhat
negative or argumentative feeling.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So if somebody says, "さくらがきれいだね" –
"Sakura's pretty, isn't it?"</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span style=
"overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 624.00px; height: 350.67px;">

title=""></span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And you say "だって頭が弱い".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Now "頭が弱い" means literally "head is
weak" – "She is not very smart".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So it would be like saying, "but
she's not very smart".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">But what you're actually doing here
is taking the statement that the last person said and adding the
copula "だ" to it.</span></p>
<h3 class="c11" id="h.anldthxli2z1"><span class=
"c29">そうです</span></h3>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And in order to understand that
let's look for a moment at something else.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Very often, when we're agreeing with
something someone says, we might say "ですね".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And literally that just means "is,
isn't it?" and how can it mean that, because really "だ or "です" on
its own doesn't mean anything.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">It has to join two other things
together, and neither of them are stated here.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">But what "です" is by implication
attached to is the thing the person just said.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And what it's joining it to is, by
implication, something like "本当" or "そう" – "そうですね".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So we're actually saying "that's

"c29">だから</span></h3>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">We also do this when we say "だから" or
"ですから", which really means "because".</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Now, we know that から means
"because"; it means literally "from" and therefore also means
"because".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">From A, B. From Fact A we can derive
Fact B. From Fact A, Fact B emerges.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So, から– "because".</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<h3 class="c11" id="h.4dl5d41f9zf6"><span class=
"c29">それから</span></h3>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">We may be tempted sometimes to say
"それから", which is a literal translation of the English "because of
that".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">But in fact "それから" doesn't get used
to mean "because of that".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"それ" means "that" and から can mean
“because", but "それから" usually means "after that"– から in the more
literal sense, から meaning "from", and in this case "from"in point
of time rather than space.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"From that forward/from that forward
in time/after that" ; "それから" – "after that".</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">To say "because of that", we say
"ですから" or "だから", and this is really short for "sそれはそうですから" or
"それは本当ですから".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">We're saying "because that is the
case", and if you think of it, this is more logical than what we
say in English.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">We're saying "because that is the
case".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"because of that" really means
literally in English "because that is the case" but we just cut it
down to "because of that", and in Japanese we just cut it down to
"ですから".</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Now, when we understand this, we can
understand "だって" in the sense of meaning "but".</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span style=

<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"だ" refers back to whatever it was
the last person said, and って simply states that they said
it.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So, if someone says, "さくらがきれいだね"–
Sakura's pretty, isn't it, isn't she?" and you reply,
"だって頭が弱い".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Now, the "but" here is your saying
"You said that...".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And "だって" is a rather childish and
argumentative sounding way of saying it, so the implication is that
what comes next is going to be negating what was said.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And this works in just the same way
as English "but".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">If you think about it, "but" is not
saying that what came before it is untrue.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">In fact it is accepting that what
came before it is true, but it's then adding some information that
is contrary to the impression given by that statement.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1 c38">So "さくらがきれいだね" – "Sakura is
pretty" – "だって..." – "You said that and I'm not disputing that that
is the case, BUT – she's not very smart".</span></p>
<h2 class="c22" id="h.jqpcmo73tf2u"><span class="c16">だって -
Because</span></h2>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So, how does it come to mean
"because", which in some ways seems almost opposed to "but", almost
an opposite kind of meaning?</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Well, let's notice that one thing
that "but" and "because" have in common is that they accept the
first statement.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">" but" goes on to say something
which contrasts with that statement, while still accepting
it.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">" because" says something that goes
on to explain that statement.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And this can be a harmonious
explanation which simply gives us more information about it, but it
can also be a contradictory explanation.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So, for example, if someone says,
"You haven't done much of your homework" and you reply, "because
you keep talking to me!" this could be expressed by "だって" in
Japanese.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Again, what it's really saying is
"You say that and I don't dispute it, but here's something we can
add to it which undermines the narrative that you are trying to put
forward."So you see, it doesn't literally mean either "but"or
"because".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">What it means is, "I accept your
statement and now I'm going to add something a bit
argumentative".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">In English it could be translated as
either "but" or "because" depending on the
circumstances.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<h2 class="c22" id="h.btcic0ykz9g"><span class="c16">だって -
Even</span></h2>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So, how can it come to have the
meaning of "even"?</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Well, let's understand that this is
a slightly different use.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">When we use it to mean "even", we're
not using the "だ" in the way we're using it when we say "だから" or
"だって" in the senses we've just talked about.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">In other words, we are not simply
using it to refer back to the last statement.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">We're usually attaching it to
something in particular within the statement we're
making.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So, if you say, "Sakuraは 出来る" –
"Sakura can do that" and I say "私だって出来る", which is generally
translated as "Even I can do that", what we're actually saying is
"Say it's me", which means in both Japanese and English "take the
hypothesis that it's me" or "take the case of me in this
circumstance" and we're saying "私だって出来る". "Say it's me, I can do
that".</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span style=
"overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 624.00px; height: 350.67px;">

title=""></span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Now, this has a different
implication from "私も出来る", which just means neutrally "I can do that
too".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"私だって", because it's very colloquial
and because it's associated with this slightly negative or
contradictory implication, it means "Even I can do
that".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And it doesn't have to be negative
in the sense of contradicting anything.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Outside the context of Sakura, we
might just say, "私だってホットケーキが作れる" – "Even I can make
hotcakes".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And in this case, we're not saying
it negatively, but that "私だって" still has the implication of "even
me".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">It still has its slightly
disparaging or negative ring, because what you're saying is here
"Even someone like me, even me, who can't usually make very much,
can make hotcakes".</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span>So I hope this makes "だって" clearer and also the
ways in which "だ/です"can be used to accept and affirm previous
statements made by oneself or by someone else and add something to
it.</span></p>

Lesson 24: Hearsay and guesses! &nbsp;〜sou da, 〜sou desu - how they
REALLY work.</a></span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">こんにちは.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Today we're going to talk about the
helper noun "そう", which can mean either likeness or hearsay, either
that something seems like something or that we are stating not our
own view or opinion but something we've heard.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Differentiating the two can seem
difficult, especially when the textbooks give you a list of
connections to nouns and verbs and various different
things.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">It's much less complicated when you
understand the underlying principle, what's actually going on with
"そう".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So you don't have to memorize a lot
of different things.</span></p>
<h2 class="c22" id="h.r94u3kh88oro"><span class="c16">そう - Looks
like</span></h2>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So, first of all, what is
"そう"?</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">It's the same "そう" that we learned
about recently that comes in "こう-そう-ああ-どう".</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span style=
"overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 624.00px; height: 350.67px;">
<img alt="" src="images/image216.jpg" style=
"width: 624.00px; height: 350.67px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);"
title=""></span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So "そう" means "like that", which
makes it of course a very good candidate for describing something
seeming like something.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">When it's used in that way, we use
it by attaching it to any one of the three engines.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span style=
"overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 624.00px; height: 350.67px;">
<img alt="" src="images/image300.jpg" style=
"width: 624.00px; height: 350.67px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);"
title=""></span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And remember, as we've learned
before, that each of the three engines can be moved behind other
cars to turn them into adjectives.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Now, once そう has been attached to an
engine the engine becomes a new adjectival noun.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">How do we attach them? We do the
same thing in every case.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">We take the last kana from the
engine.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">That is the kana that makes it what
it is, its active part.</span></p>
<ul class="c13 lst-kix_wnonbjgknp9m-0 start">
<li class="c17 c30 li-bullet-0"><span class="c1">So we take the "だ"
from the だ-engine - the "だ" or the "な" from the
だ/な-engine.</span></li>
<li class="c17 c30 li-bullet-0"><span class="c1">We take the "い"
from the い-engine.</span></li>
<li class="c17 c30 li-bullet-0"><span class="c1">And from the verb
engine, we take that last う-row kana.</span></li>
</ul>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And we just put そう onto them, so
it's a very simple connection.</span></p>
<h3 class="c11" id="h.ce5p77rru2h7"><span class="c29">With
adjectival nouns</span></h3>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And the important thing to remember
here is in the case of nouns we can't do it with an ordinary,
regular noun.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">We can only do it with an adjectival
noun.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">In other words, if an adjectival
noun is an adjectival noun to start with, we can turn it into a
different adjectival noun with そう.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">If it wasn't an adjectival noun to
start with, it can't be turned into an adjectival noun.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So if we take adjectival nouns like
"元気" ("lively" or " healthy") and "静か" (which is
"quiet").</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">If we say "静かだ" we mean "is quiet"-
if we say "元気だ" we mean "is lively or healthy".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span>If we say "元気な学生"</span><span>,
we're</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;saying "a lively or healthy
student".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Now if we take off that "だ" or "な"
and put on そう - and we say "元気そうな学生", we're saying "a lively
looking student/ a lively seeming student".</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span style=
"overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 624.00px; height: 350.67px;">
<img alt="" src="images/image208.jpg" style=
"width: 624.00px; height: 350.67px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);"
title=""></span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span>Similarly, if we say "静かな 女の子"</span><span>,
we're</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;saying "a quiet
girl".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span>If we take off that な or だ and put on そう and
say "静かそうな女の子"</span><span>, we're</span><span class=
"c1">&nbsp;saying "a quiet-seeming girl/ a quiet-looking
girl".</span></p>
<h3 class="c11" id="h.ggmv45at0tm2"><span class="c29">With
い-adjectives</span></h3>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So that's really very simple, isn't
it?</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">With adjectives that end in "い", we
simply take off that い and put そう onto it.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span>So</span><span>, if</span><span class=
"c1">&nbsp;we take "面白い" ("interesting"or "amusing"), "おいしい"
("delicious"), we just cut off the い and add そう .</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So, "面白い" means "interesting" or
"amusing", "面白そう" means "seems interesting/seems
amusing".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"おいしい" means "delicious/tasty",
"おいしそう" means it "looks delicious", it "looks tasty".</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And this is an important one to
remember because, as we've mentioned before, Japanese is a lot
stricter than English in restricting us to saying only things that
we can actually know for ourselves.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So unless you've tasted something,
you can't say it's "おいしい".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Unless you've done something, you
can't say it's "面白い" - interesting or amusing.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Logically this perhaps ought to be
so in English, but Japanese is a lot stricter about it.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span>So, it's important to know things like "面白そう",
"おいしそう"if we haven't actually tasted the</span>
<span>food,</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;done the activity or
whatever.</span></p>
<h3 class="c11" id="h.qnj3cgjoiixo"><span class="c29">With
Verbs</span></h3>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Now, with a verb we cut off the
う-row kana.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Obviously, as always, in the case of
ichidan verbs that's all we do.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And in the case of godan verbs we
use the い-stem.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span style=
"overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 624.00px; height: 350.67px;">
<img alt="" src="images/image234.jpg" style=
"width: 624.00px; height: 350.67px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);"
title=""></span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And the い-stem is what you might
call the pure stem of a verb.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">In Japanese it's called "連用形", which
means "connective-use form".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And that might sound strange because
we know that all four stems actually connect things, but while the
other three have particular uses, the "連用形", the い-stem, as well as
its particular uses, can be used to connect almost
anything.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">It can connect verbs to nouns to
make new nouns; it can link verbs to verbs to make new verbs; and
so on.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So, we connect そう to the "連用形", the
い-stem, the general-purpose connecting stem of verbs.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">What do they mean? Well, generally
speaking, they mean that something appears to be about to
happen.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So, "雨が降りそうだ" means "it looks as if
it's about to rain".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"子供が泣きそう" means "the child looks as
if she's about to cry/seems as if she's about to cry."</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span style=
"overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 624.00px; height: 350.67px;">

title=""></span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And if you see that's quite similar
to what we might say in English: "It looks like rain/ it seems as
if it's about to rain." So these usages are really quite
straightforward.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<h2 class="c22" id="h.rhh2z03p3539"><span class="c16">そう -
Hearsay</span></h2>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Now what do we do when we're using
"そう" to mean hearsay, to mean "I heard something - I'm not
reporting my own observation or feeling, I'm reporting what I got
at second-hand from somebody else"?</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Some people would say that this is
also a suffix and we have to observe different rules for applying
it, but the truth is that it is not a suffix.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">The そう we've just discussed is a
suffix.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">We join it to other words in order
to form a new word.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Whatever the word was to start with,
once そう is attached it becomes an adjectival noun.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">This is not what happens when we're
talking about hearsay.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">When we're talking about hearsay, we
use "そうだ" or "そうです" after the entire, complete sentence.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So the complete sentence becomes the
A-car of the sentence and the "そうだ" becomes the
B-engine.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And the content of the sentence is
now subordinate.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So let's take an example:
"さくらが日本人だそうだ".</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span style=

<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">What we're saying here is "I've
heard that Sakura is a Japanese person".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So, "Sakura is a Japanese person" is
all taken together as Car A, the subject of the sentence, and then
what we're saying about it is that we've heard it.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Why do we use "そうだ / そうです" to mean
"I've heard"? Well, if you think about it, it's similar to what we
might say in English.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Suppose we say "why isn't that car
in the street any more?" and you say "It seems some masked people
came and drove it away".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Now, when you say that, what that
means is that somebody told you that, doesn't it? If you'd seen it
yourself you'd have said "Some masked people came and drove it
away", but when you say "It seems some masked people came and drove
it away", what you're saying is "well, that's the story I've
heard".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And it's the same in Japanese only a
little more systematically.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span>"そうだ / そうです" when added as the B-engine to an
entire, completed sentence is always saying that this is what we've
heard, this is the information we have, for what it's
worth.</span></p>

<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">こんにちは.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Last week we talked about the helper
adjectival noun "そう" and how we use it to express what something
might be like, our impression of something, and hearsay.</span></p>
<h2 class="c22" id="h.hh1aohbb6mep"><span>ら</span><span class=
"c16">しい</span></h2>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Today we're going to talk about
other ways of expressing a similar range of ideas, how they work,
how they are similar, and how they are different.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So, we're going to look at "らしい",
which is a helper adjective.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And this is an adjective ending in
しい, which is what we can call a subclass of adjectives.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">All real adjectives, as you know,
end in い.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So-called adjectives that don't end
in い are in fact adjectival nouns.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">But a group of those い-ending
adjectives ends with しい.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">As you see, it's still ending in い
but it also has し, so it's しい.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span style=
"overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 624.00px; height: 350.67px;">
<img alt="" src="images/image38.jpg" style=

title=""></span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And the characteristic of this group
of adjectives is that on the whole they express
subjectivities.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">That is to say, not exact measurable
qualities but things which are to some extent dependent upon human
or other sentient beings' impression of them.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So, for example, "悲しい" is "sad" ;
"嬉しい" is " happy".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"難しい" means "difficult" and while
this seems somewhat more objective than "嬉しい" and "悲しい" , it's
still in some way a subjectivity because difficulty is relative to
particular individuals.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Whether you find a thing difficult
or easy depends to a large extent on who you are and what your
abilities are.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So this, as we'll see, gives us an
indication of what kind of a word this is and how it differs from
"そう".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Its use is very simple.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span style=
"overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 624.00px; height: 350.67px;">

title=""></span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Like "そう" it can be attached either
to an individual word or to a complete logical clause or
sentence.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And the attachment is absolutely
simple, because we never do anything at all except just put "らしい"
after the word or after the completed logical clause.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">We don't change anything, we don't
do anything, so it really couldn't be easier.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Now, as with "そう", if we put it
after a single word we are talking about our impressions of that
particular object.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span style=
"overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 624.00px; height: 350.67px;">
<img alt="" src="images/image211.jpg" style=
"width: 624.00px; height: 350.67px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);"
title=""></span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">If we put it after a completed
clause, we are saying "it seems to be that way".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">However, there is a
difference.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">If we put "そうだ" after a completed
clause, as you know, we complete the clause, if necessary with
another "だ" , and that usage means that we've heard that that
sentence is the case.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So if we say, "あの動物は うさぎだ そうだ" ,
we're saying "I've heard that that animal is a rabbit".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1 c38">Now, if we say, "あの動物は うさぎだ
らしい", we're saying "It seems that animal is a rabbit".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1 c38">Now, that can mean the same
thing as "うさぎだそうだ".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">It can mean "I've heard that it's a
rabbit", and sometimes the textbooks get quite convoluted and
confusing about whether "らしい" actually means "I've heard" or
whether it means "it seems", but it's very simple if you understand
exactly what it's doing.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">What it's doing is actually saying
"it appears" or "it seems", and this has exactly the same ambiguity
and lack of ambiguity as that has in English.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So let's take the case of this
mysterious animal.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Suppose I'm looking at it with a
group of people and afterwards you come up to me and say, "what is
that animal?" and I say, "うさぎだらしい".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Now, I've given a complete sentence
with "らしい" on the end, and the natural meaning here would be "I
heard from those people that it was a rabbit."</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Now, you see this is just the same
as if in English I say, "It appears that it's a rabbit." Now, you
would take me, in English and in Japanese, to be saying, "From what
I heard (from those people), it's a rabbit".</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Now, take a different
scenario.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">The rabbit's gone and I'm examining
its footprints and you come up to me and say, "what was that
animal?" and I say, "うさぎ だった らしい".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Again, "It appears that it was a
rabbit", or "It seems that it was a rabbit."</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">In this case, you would probably
conclude from what I'm doing that by saying "It appears it was a
rabbit", I'm saying, "From the evidence I'm looking at here, the
appearances are that it's a rabbit."</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So you see, there's nothing
particularly grammatical or complicated about this.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">It's just the same as in English if
you said "It appears that it's a rabbit" or "It seems that it's a
rabbit", it depends on context whether that implies that that's the
information you've heard or that that's the conclusion you're
drawing from your observations.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">If you want to be completely
unambiguous that you're talking about hearsay, that you're talking
about something you heard from other people, then you say, "うさぎ だった
そうだ".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">That is unambiguous. That can only
mean "I heard it from somebody".</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Now, when we apply "らしい" to an
individual word, the most immediate difference between "らしい" and
"そうだ" is that we can't apply "そうだ" to a regular noun.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">We can only apply it to an
adjectival noun, and there's a good reason for that. We'll get to
it in a moment.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"らしい" you can apply to any kind of
noun, whether it's an adjectival noun or whether it's a regular
noun.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">But it really comes into its own
when it's being applied to regular nouns.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">As you would expect from the fact
that it is a しい adjective – that's to say, that we would expect it
to be expressing a greater degree of subjectivity – it has the
ability to liken one thing to another.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So we can say "あの動物は うさぎ らしい" –
"that animal is rabbit-like/that animal's like a
rabbit."</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Now, the difference between this and
"そう", apart from the fact that you can only apply "そう" to
adjectival nouns – and this is why you can only apply "そう" to
adjectival nouns – is that when we say "あの動物は うさぎ らしい" we are not
necessarily conjecturing that it is in fact a rabbit.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">We may be completely aware that it
isn't a rabbit and we're simply saying that it's like a rabbit,
it's a rabbit-like animal.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And of course, we can turn it around
into that kind of an adjective too: "うさぎ らしい 動物" – "a rabbit-like
animal".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And again, it's just the same as in
English.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">If we say, "that animal looks like a
rabbit", we could mean "I'm guessing that it is a rabbit" or we
could mean "It's probably not a rabbit, but it certainly looks like
one."</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Now, this widens out into even
greater areas of subjectivity.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">For example, we can say that
something has the qualities of something.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">For example, "男らしい男" is a "manly
man", a man who possesses the qualities of a man.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span style=

title=""></span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">If we talk about someone who's not a
teacher and we say "先生らしい" – "that person's like a teacher." we
might or might not be conjecturing that she is in fact a
teacher.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span style=
"overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 624.00px; height: 350.67px;">

title=""></span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">But if we know that she's a teacher
and we say, "Sakura 先生は 先生 らしい", we mean that she behaves like a
teacher.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">She is a teacher and she has the
right qualities and manner for being a teacher.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Conversely, we could say, "Sakura
先生は , 先生 らしくない" and in that case, we're saying, "well, we know
she's a teacher, but she doesn't behave like one, she doesn't act
like a teacher."</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So you see, with "らしい" we are
getting into much more subjective areas.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">We're not simply guessing whether
something is in fact delicious or interesting, which we can confirm
by experience.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">We're talking about our impressions
and beliefs and subjectivities surrounding the
phenomenon.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Now, we can also say things like,
for example, if Sakura says something unpleasant and usually she's
a very sweet girl, we might say, "それは Sakura らしくない" – "that wasn't
like you, Sakura."</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So we're talking about the
qualities, the subjectively perceived qualities of a
thing.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So, in some areas it overlaps with
"そうだ" , but in other areas it moves forward into more subtle and
subjective areas.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<h2 class="c22" id="h.u32gyw7q9fji"><span class=
"c16">っぽい</span></h2>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Now, we're also going to quickly
look at っぽい, which is a small tsu followed by -poi, so we have a
little break between that and what we're saying.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So if we want to say "childish", we
might say "子供っぽい".</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span style=
"overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 624.00px; height: 350.67px;">

title=""></span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">It works very much like "らしい". It's
also a helper adjective.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">It's much more casual than "らしい" and
we usually hear it in exactly that form – "子供っぽい",
"うさぎっぽい".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">You can't use っぽい on the end of a
completed clause.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">You can only attach it to a
word.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And apart from its colloquial
nature, a difference in tendency from "らしい" is that "らしい" will tend
to imply that the quality is what something ought to
have.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">っぽい often tends to imply the
opposite.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">There's no hard-and-fast rule here,
but there tends to be a positive inclination in "らしい" and a
negative one in っぽい, although you will certainly hear them used the
other way round on some occasions.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So "子供 らしい" is more likely to imply
the child's behaving in a way proper to a child, whereas "子供っぽい"
tends to mean "childish".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">In fact, in English we could say "子供
らしい" means "child-like" and "子供っぽい" means "childish", although it's
not as hard and fast as that is in English.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span>It could be used the other way round without
breaking any actual laws.</span></p>

<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">こんにちは.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<h2 class="c22" id="h.2m4nctsg6e4c"><span class=
"c16">ようだ</span></h2>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Today we're going to talk about
"ようだ" and give a little mention to her cousin "みたい".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">We're going to discover that "ようだ"
constitutes the other end of a sliding scale with the expressions
of conjecture and likeness that we discussed in the last two
lessons.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span style=
"overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 624.00px; height: 350.67px;">

title=""></span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">At one end we have "そうだ" 、 at the
other end we have "ようだ" , and in the middle we have
"らしい".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">All of these expressions can be
placed at the end of a completed logical sentence in order to
express that that sentence is either what we've heard or what we
conjecture from the information we have or from what we can
see.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">But when we attach them to
individual words, then we have this sliding scale of
meaning.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">With "そうだ" , as we know, we use this
to conjecture what the quality of something is.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">We can say "おいしそうだ" - "It looks
delicious /I haven't tried it, but I think if I did, I would find
it delicious."</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">With "らしい" we have a much greater
degree of subjectivity. "らしい" overlaps with "そうだ" in many respects,
but it can also do things that "そうだ" cannot do.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">It can compare things to other
things, to things that we know they aren't.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">We can say that an animal is
"うさぎらしい" - "rabbit-like"- even though we know it isn't a
rabbit.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">We can say that a person is "子供 らしい"
- "child-like"- whether she is in fact a child or not.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">We are not necessarily conjecturing
that the animal is a rabbit or the person is a child.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">We are just making that
comparison.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Now, "ようだ" can go much
further.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">It can make an actual metaphor or
simile.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So with "ようだ" we can say such things
as "a sumo wrestler is like a mountain" or "a person runs like the
wind".</span></p>

<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Now these are, if you like, literary
style or poetic similes or metaphors.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">We're not saying that the wrestler's
anything like a mountain except in the sense that he's big and
solid.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">We're not saying that a person is in
any way like the wind except that she's fast.</span></p>
<h2 class="c22" id="h.d3t4yubv2awp"><span class=
"c16">まるで</span></h2>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And one of the ways we know when
"ように" is acting in this way is that we can use the word "まるで" with
it.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So we can say "まるで 風のように走った" - "ran
just like the wind".</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Literally, "まるで" means
"roundly".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"まる" means a "circle" or a "round",
so when we say "まるで" we mean
"roundly/wholly/completely".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And this is a hyperbole, which is
common to many languages, certainly including English.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">We might say, in English, "that
wrestler is exactly like a mountain." we might even say "I
literally froze to death."</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Now, that's the opposite of what we
really mean: we don't mean that we "literally" froze to death, we
mean that we figuratively froze to death.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">In literal reality we appear still
to be alive.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">We don't mean that the wrestler is
"exactly" like a mountain.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">There isn't any snow on top of him!
But the reason we say things like "exactly" and "literally" is to
give emphasis to a poetic simile.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And in Japanese the usual
collocation here is "まるで".</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And this also demonstrates the
difference between "ようだ / ような / ように" and the other likeness-making
expressions.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">You can't use "まるで" with "そうだ" or
"そうです".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">You shouldn't use "まるで" with
"らしい".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">It's out of place with those
expressions.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">We use "まるで" when we're going on a
kind of poetic flight of fancy.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">It's a hyperbolic expression that
signals the coming of a simile or a metaphor.</span></p>
<h2 class="c22" id="h.yckrrcuwx4lo"><span class=
"c16">のように</span></h2>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">When we say that a person is "子供らしい"
or an animal is "うさぎらしい", we are extending reality a bit; we are
comparing it to something that it could be but isn't.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Now, if we look at the usage of
these expressions, we can see that as usual in Japanese they're
very logical.</span></p>

<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">The textbooks will sometimes give
you lists of connections and ways of using them.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">But actually they all make
sense.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">We don't need a list to tell us that
"ようだ" can also be used as the adverb "ように" or that it can be placed
before something as the adjective "ような"- because these connections
are simply the same connections that you can make with any
adjectival noun.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">The only thing we have to know is
that, just like "らしい" and unlike "そうだ" , we can use it with any
kind of a noun, not just adjectival nouns.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And that also makes sense because
with both "らしい" and "ようだ" we can compare things to other things,
whereas with "そうだ" we can only conjecture at the quality of a
thing, something that can be expressed by an adjective or an
adjectival noun.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And when we attach it to a verb, as
we've seen, it has a slightly different meaning.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">However, "ようだ" has a special
connection that the others don't have.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">As you know, we can simply pop it
onto an entire sentence, as we can the other two, with the meaning
of "(that sentence) is what appears to be the case".</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span style=
"overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 624.00px; height: 350.67px;">

title=""></span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">But we can also put it onto an
entire, complete sentence with a different meaning.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">We can do it in order to turn the
whole sentence into our simile.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span style=
"overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 624.00px; height: 350.67px;">

title=""></span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So, for example, we can say "まるで
幽霊を見たかのような顔をした" - "She had a face (or made a face) exactly as if
she had seen a ghost."</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Now, as we see, "she had seen a
ghost" is an entire logical clause.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">In Japanese we have the
zero-particle for "she", but it's a complete logical clause: "she
saw a ghost" - "幽霊を見た" - "zeroが幽霊を見た".</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Now, then we put "か" onto the end of
it. What is this "か"?</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">We haven't talked an awful lot about
the か-particle because in です/ます Japanese you use it to mark a
question.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">You can use it to mark a question in
informal Japanese, which is what we usually use here, but mostly we
don't because paradoxically it doesn't seem polite to put "か" on
the end of an informal question - it tends to seem a little bit
blunt or curt.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">However, the question-marker "か" has
another important function.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And that is that it can bundle a
statement into a kind of question, and that's what's happening
here.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">We start off with "まるで" to signal
that we are going to use a simile.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Then we make our completed statement
- "幽霊 を見た" - "zeroが幽霊を見た" - "she saw a ghost".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And then we add "か" and that turns
it into a question. It gives us our "if" - "as if she had seen a
ghost". And that "か" gives us our questioning "if".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">In fact, she hadn't seen a ghost, so
this isn't really a statement; it's a possibility, a potentiality,
an if.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">What she actually did perhaps was
saw the fees that PayPal charged her for an international money
transfer.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">We're not suggesting that she really
saw a ghost.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">We are suggesting that the face she
manifested - "顔をした"- was similar to the face that she would have
manifested if - "か"- she had seen a ghost.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span>Now, the other thing that we need to understand
about this "か" is that it in effect</span>
<span>nominalizes</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;the logical clause
that it marks.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span style=
"overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 624.00px; height: 350.67px;">
<img alt="" src="images/image22.jpg" style=
"width: 624.00px; height: 350.67px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);"
title=""></span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So what it's doing is turning this
complete logical clause into a question, a hypothesis, an if, that
then functions structurally as a noun.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So it can be marked by -no, which
can only happen to a noun.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And so this new noun, this object
that we've created from an entire logical clause, can now be
connected to another noun by the particle -no.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"よう" is a "form" or a "likeness" -
"山のよう" is the form of a mountain, "風のよう" is the form or likeness of
the wind, and in this case, "幽霊を見たかのよう" is the likeness of this
object that we've created from the hypothesis of having seen a
ghost.</span></p>
<h2 class="c22" id="h.liogr25u42gk"><span class=
"c16">みたい</span></h2>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Now, again, this is not something we
can do with any of the others.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">We can't even do it with "みたい",
which works in most respects pretty much exactly the same as
"のよう".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"みたい" is the less formal cousin of
"you" and broadly means the same thing and broadly can be used in
the same ways.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">It's an adjectival noun just like
that "よう", can be used with "に" to make it an adverb or with "な" to
make it a before-the-noun adjective just as any adjectival noun can
be.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span style=
"overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 624.00px; height: 350.67px;">

title=""></span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">The main thing to remember about it
is simply that it's less formal, so you don't use it in an
essay.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">On the other hand, you might prefer
to choose it when you're talking to a friend over "ようだ" in many
cases, just because it sounds a bit less formal and a bit more
friendly.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">But you can't use it with a
completed sentence.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">You can use it with a complete
sentence in order to conjecture that that statement is the case,
but you can't use it with "か" to use a complete sentence as a
simile.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">You have to use "かのようだ / かのように" for
that.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">The other thing to note is that
sometimes, probably because it is very casual, the "だ" or "です" gets
left off from "みたい".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">You might say "まるで羊みたい" - "just like
a sheep".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">This isn't correct grammar - you
ought to say "みたいだ" - but it's very common to leave it
off.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span>It's not common to leave it off of
"ようだ".</span></p>

Lesson 27: Bakari meanings:: crazy patchwork or logical
pattern?</a></span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">こんにちは.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Today we're going to talk about
"ばかり", which is one of those Japanese expressions that the
textbooks can be very confusing about.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">They will tell you that it has a
number of different, seemingly random meanings which attach with
different grammar structures that you have to memorize.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">It's another of these laundry lists
that the textbooks love to give you.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Fortunately, as is often the case,
we can cut through all this simply by looking at what the word
really means and how it logically works in different
situations.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">This will give us a key both to the
meanings and to the structure in its different uses.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"ばかり" is essentially a
noun.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">You'll hear it described as other
things, but in practice it works as a noun.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">We use "だ" after it, which we can
only do with a noun, although sometimes we will find the "だ" or
"です"left off in casual speech, just as with "みたい", which we
discussed last week.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">I notice that a lot of the times
when a "だ" or "です"is left off, the word does end in -i, so I think
that might be a slight influence from adjectives, although it is
not an adjective.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">It is a noun.</span></p>
<h2 class="c22" id="h.wxfv02ik9tzo"><span class=
"c16">Just</span></h2>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So what does it mean? Its meaning is
very simple.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">It means "just" or "nothing
but".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And one of the commonest uses is
simply to place it after a past tense statement to say that that
has "just" taken place.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">It works exactly the same as in
English.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">If we say "来たばかり" - "I just came"-
that's exactly what we also say in English: "I just came" or even
"I only just came".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span>It means that</span> <span>something has
happened</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;a very short time
ago.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Why do we use, both in English and
Japanese, a word meaning "nothing but"in this case? Well, like many
words, it is a hyperbole.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">We discussed hyperboles in the case
of "まるで" in the last lesson, didn't we?</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">When we say "I just came / 来たばかり",
we are saying that nothing has happened except that I
came.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">I came such a short time ago that
there hasn't been time for anything else:</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"I just came / I only just came /
来たばかり".</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Now, this is very often very much a
hyperbole.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Suppose, for example, that we meet a
friend in the street and the friend says "Let's go for coffee and
cakes" and we say "食べたばかり" - "I just ate".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Now, what we're literally saying
here is that I ate such a short time ago - milliseconds ago - that
nothing else has happened in between eating and now.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Now, obviously that's not literally
true.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">One must have left the place where
one did the eating and walked down the street at least.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">But hyperbolically we're saying that
we ate and nothing else happened between then and now.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">The textbooks will tell you that
this use of "ばかり" is attached to the plain past of a
verb.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Now, that's true, but it's also
confusing for two reasons.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">First of all, saying "plain past"
implies this whole world where we are taught that the "real" forms
of verbs are the "ます" forms, so we have to deconstruct them every
time we do anything with them.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">We don't need to say "plain past",
because everything we do with a verb inside of a sentence we are
doing to the plain form of the verb even if we are using formal
Japanese by putting ''です'' and ''ます'' on the end.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"です" and "ます" are nothing more than
decorative appendages that we put at the very end of a
sentence.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">The other thing that makes this
explanation confusing is that while it's true that we do put it
after the past form of a verb, we are not really attaching it to
the past form of the verb.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">This is not logically what's
happening.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And it's one of those things that
makes it sound like a random rule when it isn't.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">What we are attaching "ばかり" to is a
completed action.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And what we are saying is how long
ago it happened.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">We're saying it happened a very very
short time ago.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So we have to have a completed
action and of course it has to be in the past, because that's what
we're saying about it.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">If it were in the non-past it
wouldn't make any sense, would it? So we can say it attaches to the
plain past of the verb or we can say it attaches exactly where it
logically has to attach and where it would make no sense if it
didn't.</span></p>
<h2 class="c22" id="h.lm1tv4bnuv58"><span>Only</span></h2>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Now, the next use of "ばかり" is one
that people sometimes find confusing because it expresses that
there is a great deal of something.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Now, "ばかり" obviously is a limiting
word, so why is it used to express that there is a great deal of
something?</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Now, once again, this is perfectly
logical and natural and we use it in English as well.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">If we say "there are nothing but
cakes in that shop!"- now, we may mean it literally, but very often
we mean there are other things, but there are an awful lot of
cakes.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">When I was staying in the
countryside in Japan and I was moving to Tokyo for a while,
somebody I knew there thought it was a bad idea for me to move to
Tokyo and said, "東京は外人ばかりだ" - "In Tokyo there's nothing but
foreigners."</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span>Now of course this person did not mean that
there</span> <span>was</span><span>&nbsp;nothing but foreigners in
Tokyo; he meant that there are a lot of foreigners in Tokyo - and
he knows that I don't want to be associating with foreigners who
are going to start talking English</span> <span>at
me</span><span class="c1">.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">(It's all right - I avoided
that.)</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So this is just a very obvious,
natural use of "ばかり".</span></p>
<h2 class="c22" id="h.6s7f0ihqp8qn"><span class="c16">A lot,
continuously</span></h2>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Now, we can extend this further by
saying that someone is doing something a lot or is doing it
continuously.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Again, the textbooks give you these
two meanings and make it sound a little complicated, but there's
nothing complicated about it.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">It's very easy to understand from
context.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">The way we do it is that we put
"ばかり" after the て-form of the verb.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So, if you've ever heard "犬のおまわりさん",
which is a charming children's song about a lost kitten:
"まいごのまいごの子猫-chan"- I'll put a link below so you can listen to it if
you would like to.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Now, when the dog policeman ("犬の
おまわりさん") asks the kitten what her name is and where she lives, the
song says "泣いてばかりいる子猫ちゃん".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Now, "泣いてばかり" means "doing nothing
but cry".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">That's what it literally means, and
in this case it means it quite literally.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">She did nothing but cry.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">She went on crying and she didn't
answer, she didn't say what her name was or where she
lived.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And that's where we get the idea of
continuing to do something.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">You don't stop doing it, you don't
do anything else, you go on doing it: "してばかり".</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">It can also be used
figuratively.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">You can say that somebody does
nothing but play golf.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Now, in this case it's a hyperbole,
isn't it? Nobody does nothing but play golf.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Everybody sometimes eats, sometimes
sleeps, and occasionally plays "Captain Toad", because everybody
plays "Captain Toad" sometimes.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So we have a hyperbole.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">We're not saying that someone
continues doing something and doesn't do anything else.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">We're saying that they do it an
awful lot.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">It's a simple enough hyperbole and
exactly the same hyperbole that we would have in English: "She does
nothing but play Nintendo".</span></p>
<h2 class="c22" id="h.yc84wep5dxyn"><span>ばかりか</span></h2>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Now, "ばかり" can also be used to make
two conjunctions.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Conjunctions, as we know, are things
that connect together two complete logical clauses in a compound
sentence.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So we can say "歌ったばかりか踊った" - "she
didn't just sing, she also danced".</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span style=
"overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 624.00px; height: 350.67px;">

title=""></span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Now, the only thing you really have
to understand here is the use of "か".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"か", as we know, is the question
marker and, as we discussed last week, it can turn a statement into
a hypothesis, a question for discussion.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">But it can also do another thing and
that is it can, especially in colloquial usage, throw things into
the negative.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And we have the same in English,
don't we? When we ask a question in order to show a
negative.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">We can say "Do you think I'm going
to do that?" meaning "I'm not going to do that" and it's the same
with "か" in Japanese: in some cases we put "か" after something to
say it isn't the case.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So if we say "ばかり" we're saying
"only that is the case" and if we say "ばかりか" we're saying "not only
that is the case".</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<h2 class="c22" id="h.84fb3rb0bfxh"><span class=
"c16">ばかりに</span></h2>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">The other common conjunction we make
with "ばかり" is "ばかりに".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"に" can sometimes be added to
something in order to make a conjunction.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">We've seen this with "のに" and I made
a video about this a while ago which you may want to
watch.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"ばかりに" is an explanatory
conjunction.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">We're saying that something happened
and then we're putting a "because" on the end of it and saying it
was because something else happened.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">The most usual explanatory
conjunctions are から or "ので", but "ばかりに" has a special
implication.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">It's not just saying that something
happened because of something, it's saying that it happened JUST
because of something.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Again we can liken "ばかり" to English
"just".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"耳が大きいばかりに誰も遊んでくれない" - "Just because
my ears are big, no one will play with me."</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span style=
"overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 624.00px; height: 350.67px;">

title=""></span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">The textbooks will perhaps caution
you here that "ばかりに" doesn't necessarily mean this conjunction, and
that's true.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">But understanding it from context is
simple because we all know that a conjunction can only sit at the
end of a complete logical clause that's followed by another logical
clause.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">If "ばかりに" is not on the end of a
logical clause then it's not the conjunction, and if it's in the
middle of a sentence, which it normally will be, it must make sense
to put a comma after it.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span>Because all conjunctions must logically be able
to take a comma after them.</span></p>

<p class="c0"><span class="c1">こんにちは.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Today we're going to talk about "ように
なる", "ように する", "ことに なる", and "ことに する".</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span style=
"overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 624.00px; height: 350.67px;">

title=""></span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Now, all the elements of these
expressions we've already learned, so what we need to do now is to
see how they fit together in these cases, what they mean, and why
they mean what they mean.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<h2 class="c22" id="h.btnbsolv56un"><span class="c16">になる /
にする</span></h2>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So let's just do a quick recap of
"になる" and "にする".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span style=
"overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 624.00px; height: 350.67px;">
<img alt="" src="images/image317.jpg" style=

title=""></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">As we know, the two primordial
Japanese verbs are "ある" and "する".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"ある" is the mother of all self-move
verbs and "する" is the father of all other-move verbs.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"なる" is closely related to "ある" --
"ある" means "be" ; "なる" means "become"-- so we can say that "ある" and
"なる" are the static and dynamic versions of the same
verb.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">That is, the same verb being still
and moving in time.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Now, we know that when we use a noun
followed by "になる", we mean that something turns into that
noun.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"に" marks the target of the
transformation and "なる" is the transformation itself, the
becoming.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So、 when we say "ように
なる"...</span></p>
<h2 class="c22" id="h.9xh1giypdbkx"><span class=
"c16">ようになる</span></h2>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Well, we looked at "you"last week,
didn't we, and we saw that when we're comparing things or likening
things "you" means a "form"or a "likeness".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Its basic meaning is a form or a
state of being.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">When we say "rikishiは や ma の ようだ" --
"sumo wrestler is like a mountain"-- we're not saying that the sumo
wrestler "is" a mountain, we're extracting the form or the state of
being of the mountain and applying it to the sumo
wrestler.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span style=
"overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 624.00px; height: 350.67px;">
<img alt="" src="images/image238.jpg" style=
"width: 624.00px; height: 350.67px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);"
title=""></span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">We're not saying that the sumo
wrestler is the mountain, we're saying that the wrestler is the
mountain's "よう", the mountain's form or state of being.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So in English we say the wrestler is
"like" the mountain; in Japanese we say the wrestler is the form or
the state of being of the mountain -- we might say, the
"likeness"of the mountain.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Now, when we use "よう"in the
expressions we're talking about today, we don't add them to a noun
like "やま", we add them to a complete logical clause.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">The textbooks sometimes say we're
adding them to a verb, but what we're really doing is adding them
to a logical clause with a verb-engine.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span style=
"overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 624.00px; height: 350.67px;">
<img alt="" src="images/image126.jpg" style=
"width: 624.00px; height: 350.67px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);"
title=""></span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And "よう", as we know, is a noun; the
logical clause becomes the adjectival, the descriptor, for that
noun, so we know that any verb-engine together with the logical
clause it heads can become an adjectival so we're not saying "no
you", we're not saying the likeness of something else
here.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So when we have a logical clause
plus "ように なる", we're saying that something became or entered the
state of being or the form of that logical clause.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So, for example, if we say "kare を
shinjいる ように なった", we're saying "I came to believe him."</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span style=
"overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 624.00px; height: 350.67px;">
<img alt="" src="images/image149.jpg" style=
"width: 624.00px; height: 350.67px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);"
title=""></span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Kare を shinjいる" (or "zeroが kare を
shinjいる") --"I believe him"-- is a logical clause, and we're saying
that I moved into the state, I became the state of that logical
clause: "I came to believe him." this is often used with a
potential helper verb.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">For example, we might say, "日本語 の
mangaが 読める ように なった" -- "Japanese manga became readable (to
me)".</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span style=
"overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 624.00px; height: 350.67px;">
<img alt="" src="images/image12.jpg" style=
"width: 624.00px; height: 350.67px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);"
title=""></span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">As you see, in both cases something
is changing its state.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">I change my state from not believing
him to believing him; the manga changes its state from being
non-readable to being readable.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">In all cases we are talking about a
change of state, a change of the existing state in someone or
something from one condition to another.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And if you're wondering why we most
often in Japanese speak of the manga changing state from being
non-readable to readable rather than speaking, as in English we
usually do, of the person changing state from not being able to
read the manga to being able to read the manga, please watch the
video lesson on the potential helper verb where I explain how this
works.</span></p>
<h2 class="c22" id="h.nxmxxyjif1or"><span class=
"c16">ようにする</span></h2>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Now, when we say "ように する" we know
that the "にする"construction is the other-move version of the
"になる"construction.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">If we say "majoが Sakura を kaeruに
shita", we're saying "the witch turned Sakura into a
frog".</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span style=
"overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 624.00px; height: 350.67px;">
<img alt="" src="images/image195.jpg" style=
"width: 624.00px; height: 350.67px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);"
title=""></span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So "ように する" is to make something
enter a state.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">It doesn't enter it by itself;
somebody's making it enter the state.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So if we say "yoku 見える ように する" --
"yoku 見える" means to "look good", so "yoku 見える ように する" is to make
someone or something look good.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span style=
"overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 624.00px; height: 350.67px;">
<img alt="" src="images/image180.jpg" style=
"width: 624.00px; height: 350.67px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);"
title=""></span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Now, "ように する" has an extended sense,
and that is when we say something essentially equivalent to "please
make sure that you do something".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So, we can say "doaに kagi を kakeru
ように してください" and that means "please make it so that you lock the
door".</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span style=
"overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 624.00px; height: 350.67px;">
<img alt="" src="images/image266.jpg" style=
"width: 624.00px; height: 350.67px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);"
title=""></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And I think you can see the
difference here between simply saying "doaに kagi を kakete ください" ,
which is just "please lock the door".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">In one case you're kind of assuming
that the person will simply lock it as a matter of course; in the
second case you're making a very special point of it: "Please make
it so that you lock the door (this is important, so please make it
be that way)".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"It"in this case is just the same as
it would be in English -- the "situation", the "circumstance" --
"Please turn the circumstance from one in which you don't lock the
door into one in which you do lock the door."So this makes a very
special point of this instruction or advice.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Now, related to this is when you may
say something about yourself, usually related to something you do
regularly, such as saying "mainichi 歩く ように する".</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span style=
"overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 624.00px; height: 350.67px;">
<img alt="" src="images/image370.jpg" style=
"width: 624.00px; height: 350.67px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);"
title=""></span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And that means literally, "I make it
so that I walk every day".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">But when you put it this way, rather
than just saying "mainichi 歩く", which is simply saying "I walk
every day", the implication is that you try to do so.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">You might not necessarily always
succeed.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And, you see, as with the other
usage, there's some doubt as to whether you will do it.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">You don't say "Please make it so
that you lock the door"unless there is in your mind a certain doubt
as to whether this is going to happen and you're trying to make it
so that it does.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">When you say it about yourself --
"mainichi 歩く ように する"-- there is also another factor in play in that
when it's yourself you could also use "ことに する", and that expresses
a firm decision which we'll talk about next week in the second half
of this lesson.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So if you choose "ように する"over "ことに
する"you're inherently leaving a little room for doubt.</span></p>
<h2 class="c22" id="h.dm2bkcv5ubqx"><span class=
"c16">ように</span></h2>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Now, "ように"can also be used with a
clause behind it and a clause in front of it, in order to say "do
one thing in order that another thing may happen".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">The textbooks treat this as if it
were a different piece of grammar, a different grammar point, but
in fact it isn't, it's the same as plain "ように する", and the only
reason it seems a bit different is because we put it a little
differently in English.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">But we shouldn't be thinking about
English; we should be thinking about Japanese.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So let's take a look at how this
works.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Let's take a sentence that we've
already had: "yoku 見える ように する" -- "make something (or someone) look
better".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Now, let's change that to "yoku 見える
ように kuchibeni を tsukeru" -- "in order that she will look better (or
I will look better, or someone will look better), apply
lipstick".</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span style=
"overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 624.00px; height: 350.67px;">

title=""></span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Now, as you see, in English the ways
of putting those two ideas are different, and that's why the
textbooks and the conventional explanations talk as if we had two
separate, unrelated grammar points.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">But if you look at what's going on,
you can see that they're actually the same thing.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">In one case we're saying "make
someone or something look better" without specifying the
means.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">We're just using the neutral,
catch-all verb "する", which is the fundamental other-move
verb.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">When we say "yoku 見える ように kuchibeni
を tsukeru", "kuchibeni を tsukeru"is simply replacing the
"する".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Instead of unspecifically saying
simply "make someone look better", it's saying "do a specific thing
in order to make someone look better".</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Now, "する" is also an action; it's
just an unspecified action.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">It's just "do/act/make something
happen".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Kuchibeni を tsukeru"specifies what
that "する"might be in a particular case.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So you see, we have exactly the same
construction here, not two separate "grammar points", as they like
to call them.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And one final note is that you will
sometimes hear "ように"on the end of a sentence, usually a ます-ending
sentence.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">This is used primarily for prayers
and petitions.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>

Japan.</span></p>

it's a kind of shortening of "ように する".</span></p>

<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span>こんにちは</span><span class="c1">.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Today we're going to discuss "ことに
する" and "ことに なる".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Last week we looked at "ように する" and
"ように なる" and we briefly recapitulated the fact that when we say
"(something)に なる" we mean that the thing we're speaking about
turned into whatever is marked by に.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So if we say "Sakuraは kaeruに なった",
we're saying Sakura turned into a frog.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">If we say "に する", we're saying that
someone deliberately turned what we're talking about into the
ni-marked noun.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So, if we say "Majoが Sakura を kaeruに
shita", we're saying the witch turned Sakura into a
frog.</span></p>
<h2 class="c22" id="h.1obci3xwsmre"><span class=
"c16">ことにする</span></h2>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So, what about "ことに する" and "ことに
なる"? We know that "こと" means a "thing", not a concrete thing like a
book or pencil but an abstract thing, a situation, or a
circumstance.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So, if we say "Kekkon する ことに shita",
we're saying literally: It became the thing of getting
married.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span style=
"overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 624.00px; height: 350.67px;">
<img alt="" src="images/image321.jpg" style=
"width: 624.00px; height: 350.67px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);"
title=""></span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Obviously we have to have a
zero-pronoun here, because something has to become
something.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So, what's "it"? Well, "it"is what
it might be in English: "the situation / the
circumstance".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">" the circumstance turned into one
in which we're getting married/in which getting married is the
thing." we have to use "こと" here because, as you know, we can't
attach the logical particle に, or any other logical particle, to
anything but a noun.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So, we use "kekkon する" as the
modifier for "こと" in order to give us a noun of the situation or
circumstance of getting married.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So what does it mean? "we turned the
situation into the thing of getting married" means "we decided to
get married"/ "we brought about a situation in which getting
married was the thing".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And so the textbooks will tell you
that "ことに する" means "decide (something)", and it's not quite as
simple as that, as we'll see in a moment.</span></p>
<h2 class="c22" id="h.o3ps2bgj4t30"><span class=
"c16">ことになる</span></h2>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">However, if we say "Furansuで
ryuugaku する ことに なった", we're saying "It became the thing of studying
in France", which really means "It came about that I am going to
study in France".</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span style=
"overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 624.00px; height: 350.67px;">
<img alt="" src="images/image279.jpg" style=
"width: 624.00px; height: 350.67px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);"
title=""></span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">The situation turned from one in
which I'm not going to study in France to one in which I am going
to study in France.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Now because "ことに する" is a deliberate
act done by whoever is making the decision, "ことに なる" is taken to
imply in many cases a deliberate decision.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So we can translate this most of the
time as "they're sending me to France to study"/ "It's been decided
that I'm going to France to study." the thing to notice here,
though, is that there's no actual mention of a decision by anyone,
and in this case it doesn't matter if we assume that that's what it
means, because it probably does.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Some people will say "Kekkon する ことに
なった", which kind of means "It's been decided that we're getting
married"or, more literally, "It's come about that we're getting
married".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And the reason for saying this is
that, even though in this day and age, the people who decide that
they're getting married are almost always the people who are
actually getting married, it sounds a little less forceful, a
little less ego-centred, not to say "we've decided..." but just to
say "It's been decided..."or "It's come about..." and I have to say
that sounds a little bit more pleasant to me as well, but I'm just
an android, so what do I know?</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">However, we may also say "taihen-na
ことに なった", and what that means is "It became -- the situation became
-- a terrible thing".</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span style=
"overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 624.00px; height: 350.67px;">
<img alt="" src="images/image346.jpg" style=
"width: 624.00px; height: 350.67px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);"
title=""></span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And this does not carry any
implication that anybody decided it ought to be a terrible
thing.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">It does not imply a decision, and
there's no reason it would, because there's no mention of decision
anywhere in "ことに する"or "ことに なる".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">In many cases a decision is implied,
but in cases like this -- and there are many times when you'll see
"ことに なる" working in this way -- all it's telling us is that the
situation came about, not that anybody decided that the situation
should come about.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So this is why it's important to
learn structure in Japanese, because if we just get a handful of
Japanese and a handful of English thrown at us -- "ことに なる" means
"it is decided"-- well, sometimes it does and sometimes it
doesn't.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">The important thing to know is
what's actually going on in the sentence.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Then we can make a sensible
assessment ourselves of what's being said when we see it in an
anime or a book or in conversation.</span></p>

Lesson 30: Japanese conditionals: とTO. What the textbooks don't
tell you.</a></span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">こんにちは.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Today we're going to start talking
about Japanese conditionals.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Conditionals are when you say
something like "If..."or "when..." and in Japanese there are a
number of different conditionals, and this can cause some confusion
to learners.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Which one do we use, and when, and
why? As usual, we tend to get a list of these things from the
text-books with complicated instructions, and as usual it helps a
great deal if we can understand the underlying logic.</span></p>
<h2 class="c22" id="h.3szccd4t4oji"><span>と and や</span></h2>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So, this lesson we're going to start
with the conditional と .</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Now, we've already met this と
.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">It is the "exclusive
and"particle.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">I'm not talking about Boolean logic
here.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">I'm talking about the fact that
Japanese has two words for "and" which are used to connect two
nouns.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">One is - や , and - や is the same as
English "and".</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span style=
"overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 624.00px; height: 350.67px;">

title=""></span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">It means one thing "and" another
"and"possibly other things too.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">If we say " hat and coat", we may
well have on shoes and skirt and pants and other things too, but we
just say " hat and coat".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">In Japanese, if we say "pen や hon" –
"pen and book"– we're saying, just like English "and", "a pen and a
book and maybe some other things and maybe not".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">But if we say "pen to hon", that is
exclusive.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">We're saying "pen and book and
nothing else".</span></p>
<h2 class="c22" id="h.7bcf9zpzwlvu"><span>と -</span> <span class=
"c16">Conditional</span></h2>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Now, this is important to understand
because this is exactly the same と that we use as a
conditional.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">The textbooks tend to introduce this
と as if it were something different from the "and" と , but it's not
– it's the same.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">There is another と and that is the
quotation particle which we've covered at some length in more than
one lesson.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">That is separate from the "and" と
.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">But the conditional と is not: it's
the same と .</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And when we understand that, it
becomes much easier to see what's going on with this particular
conditional.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Now, one more thing we need to know
is that this と is a particle, but it's not a logical
particle.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And it's not a non-logical particle
either.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">What do I mean by this? Well, a
logical particle is a particle that marks the case of a
noun.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Now, you don't need to know what
that means – it's not important to get that theoretical
knowledge.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">What it means is, in plain English,
that it tells us what the noun is doing in the sentence in relation
to other nouns and in relation to the verb.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">The が particle tells us that the
noun is being or doing something; the を particle tells us that it
is having something done to it; the に particle tells us that it is
a target.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So what logical particles do is tell
us who is doing what to whom and where and when.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Non-logical particles は and も mark
the topic, which is not a logical construction.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">They tell us what noun we're talking
about but they don't tell us what part it plays in the
sentence.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Now the point about logical
particles is that they must attach to nouns.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">They can't do anything other than
attach to a noun.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And this is obvious, because that's
their function – to tell us what role a noun plays in a
sentence.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;と is not a logical particle
and therefore, while it can attach to nouns, it can also attach to
a logical clause and that's what allows it to be a
conditional.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">All right. So now we know enough to
go ahead.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">If I say, "fuyuに なる と samuku なる" –
"when it becomes winter (or, if it becomes winter) it gets
cold."</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span style=
"overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 624.00px; height: 350.67px;">

title=""></span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So why is this connected with the
"exclusive and"function of と ? It is connected with it because what
we are saying is that only one possibility exists, only one result
can follow from what we're talking about.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">If winter comes, it will get cold –
there's no other possibility.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">If rain falls, the ground will get
wet – there's no other possibility.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">It can also be used in a hyperbolic
fashion.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">We've talked about hyperboles
before, haven't we? This is where you say something that exceeds
the truth.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And human language does this all the
time.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So, someone might say "sore を 食べる と
byoukiに なる" – "If you eat that, you will get sick."</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span style=
"overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 624.00px; height: 350.67px;">

title=""></span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Now, this is not like winter coming
and it getting cold or the rain falling and the ground getting
wet.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">It's possible that you might eat it
and not get sick, but this is a hyperbole.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">What you are trying to say to
someone is "If you eat that, you will get sick".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"If you keep playing those games,
you'll fail the exam."Now again, it's possible that the person
might keep playing the games and still get through the exam, but
the hyperbole is "Do A and B will happen".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Keep playing those games and you'll
fail the exam.""Eat that and you'll get sick." we are putting
something forward as an inevitable result, an exclusive result, a
result to which no other alternative exists.</span></p>
<h2 class="c22" id="h.6cnhjh9wc6kp"><span class="c16">と -
Obligation</span></h2>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Now, we can also use this と to mean
that something is necessary.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">We can say "ikanai と dame" – "If I
don't go, it will be bad."</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span style=

title=""></span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;"勉強 shinai と ikenai"–
literally, "If I don't study, it can't go" but what that means is
"If I don't study, it won't be good" ("...it won't do", as we might
say in English).</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And what it actually means is "I
must study / I've got to study".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And very often you'll hear this just
on its own.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">For example, "nigenai と
!"</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span style=
"overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 624.00px; height: 350.67px;">

title=""></span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And that just means, literally "we
don't run and..." that's to say, "If we don't run..." and the
implication here is that if we don't run, something bad will
happen.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So if in an anime somebody says,
"nigenai と !" they're really just saying "Run! / We must run." and
in this sense, と , because it is so absolute, because it is so
exclusive, is stronger and a little more colloquial than similar
uses like ba/reba.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span>And we'll talk about the ba/reba construction
next time.</span></p>

Lesson 31: The BA conditional. What it really means and how to use
it easily.</a></span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">こんにちは. Today we're going to talk
about the conditional -ba/-reba.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Last week we looked at the と
conditional and we saw that its particular characteristic was its
exclusiveness, its implication that only one outcome is
possible.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">In many cases we can use any or most
of the conditionals without changing the meaning to any great
extent, but each conditional has its own particular
qualities.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So today we're going to look at the
special quality of -ba/-reba and some of the things it does and why
it does them.</span></p>
<h2 class="c22" id="h.4cidl9oky39h"><span class="c16">Conjugation -
Verbs</span></h2>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">First of all, what is
-ba/-reba?</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;-Ba/-reba is a helper which we
put on to the e-stem of a verb.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span style=
"overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 624.00px; height: 350.67px;">
<img alt="" src="images/image10.jpg" style=
"width: 624.00px; height: 350.67px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);"
title=""></span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">The e-stem is one of the lesser used
stems but -ba /-reba is one of the things that uses it.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So, for godan verbs we put it on to
the e-stem and for ichidan verbs, as always, we simply put it on to
.... we simply take off the る and add the ichidan form,
-reba.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">For the two irregular verbs, in this
case they work exactly like regular ichidan verbs.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So "kuru" becomes "ku-reba" and "する"
becomes "su-reba".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Actually, "kuru" and "する", I would
say, are in fact ichidan verbs, but they're strong ichidan
verbs.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">A strong verb is a verb that can
change its vowel sound.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">In English we have "come" and
"came", "eat and "ate".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And "kuru" and "する" in some cases
change their vowel sound.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Kuru"in the negative becomes
"konai", "する" becomes "shinai".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">But in this case they don't change
their vowel sound at all, so that's very simple -- they just work
like the ichidan verbs that they fundamentally are.</span></p>
<h2 class="c22" id="h.r0wdxr7zjvuk"><span class="c16">Conjugation -
Adjective</span></h2>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">For adjectives, we take off the -i
and use the helper -kereba.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span style=
"overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 624.00px; height: 350.67px;">
<img alt="" src="images/image145.jpg" style=
"width: 624.00px; height: 350.67px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);"
title=""></span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">You might notice that when we do
anything with an adjective other than simply take off the -i and
add whatever we're going to add, the specific adjectival
modifications all come from the ka-kiく-ke-ko row.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So, the negative of an adjective is
くnai ("面白い" --&gt; "omoshiroくnai"); the past is -katta ("面白い"
--&gt; "omoshiro-katta"); and the -ba conditional is -kereba ("面白い"
--&gt; "omoshiro-kereba").</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So in a way we could say that if
adjectives had an e-stem, it would be -ke.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And that's what we use in that
case.</span></p>
<h2 class="c22" id="h.uv2y3vff4256"><span class=
"c16">Conditional</span></h2>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So what's the special characteristic
of -ba/-reba?</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">To, as we know, its special
characteristic is its exclusiveness.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">The special characteristic of
-ba/-reba is that it is used for hypotheticals. So it must always
mean "if".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">It can't ever mean "when", because
we never know for sure if the condition will take place and
consequently if we use it about something that happened in the past
it has to be something that didn't happen because if it did happen
we wouldn't be dealing with a hypothesis, we'd be dealing with a
fact.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Now this hypothetical nature of
-ba/-reba allows it to be used in many common and very important
Japanese expressions.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">For example, "dou su-reba
ii".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">What this literally means is " how,
if I act, will be good".</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span style=
"overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 624.00px; height: 350.67px;">
<img alt="" src="images/image5.jpg" style=
"width: 624.00px; height: 350.67px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);"
title=""></span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And I'll just note here that while
"する" is generally translated as "do", in many cases the best way to
render it into English is as "act".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So, for example, if we say "静かに する",
we're not saying "do quietly", we're saying "act
quietly".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So, "do su-reba ii" -- " how, if I
act, will be good".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And in English what we'd normally
say is "what should I do?" but in Japanese we don't say
that.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">As we'll see, this is partly because
the concept of "should"isn't quite the same in Japanese, and
-ba/-reba is often used to solve the problem.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">We'll come back to that in a
moment.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Another common use of -ba/-reba is
in "su-reba よかった".</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span style=
"overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 624.00px; height: 350.67px;">
<img alt="" src="images/image233.jpg" style=
"width: 624.00px; height: 350.67px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);"
title=""></span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">For example, "kasa を motteku-reba
よかった".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">In English we would say "I should
have brought an umbrella".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">What we're actually saying here is
"If I had brought an umbrella, it would have been good".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Mottekuru", as I've explained
elsewhere, we join the word "carry" and the word "come" to mean
"bring" ("carry と -here") and we notice that "よかった" throws it into
the past tense.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">As you know, in Japanese, we mark
the past tense at the end of a logical clause.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So even though it may be true that
if it's raining right now, if I had brought an umbrella it would
have been good and it still would be good, we throw the whole thing
into the past tense with that final "よかった".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Kasa を motteku-reba よかった" -- "I
should have brought an umbrella / I wish I had brought an
umbrella."Now notice that in both these cases, "do su-reba ii"/
"kasa を motteku-reba よかった", we are using this "if it were done, it
would be good" to mean "should".</span></p>
<h2 class="c22" id="h.bd7iz13hlj10"><span class=
"c16">Obligation</span></h2>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And this happens again in an even
commoner Japanese construction.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">" 勉強 shina-kereba ikeません" -- "If I
don't study, it won't go / it won't do."</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span style=
"overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 624.00px; height: 350.67px;">
<img alt="" src="images/image204.jpg" style=
"width: 624.00px; height: 350.67px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);"
title=""></span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Now what we are actually saying here
is "I must study".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">There actually isn't a word for
"must"in Japanese, so we always construct it this way.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">We say "If I don't... (whatever it
is)" and then we can say "it won't be good / it will be bad / it'll
be a disaster..."</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Whatever we say, some negative
construction then follows this, and what we're saying is "I must go
/ I've got to go / I've got to do this / I've got to do that", and
this is because we don't have that construction "got to" and we
don't have "must"in Japanese.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">It always has this rather lengthy
"If I don't do, it won't be good / if I don't do, it won't do / If
I don't do, it's bad" -- "na-kereba dame".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And because it is indeed a very
long-winded way of saying something common like "must"or "got to",
it often gets cut down in casual speech to just "shina-kereba"or
even "shina-k や ", which is short for "shina-kereba", without
adding the negative ending, because that's just implied.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">However, even in very casual speech
it's often said in full, and I think this is to emphasize the
nature of the "must".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Naze ikana-kereba ikenai?" -- "why
have I got to come?"In cases like that, where we're putting stress
on it as opposed to cases where we're just saying casually "ikana-k
や " -- "I've got to go".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span>So this is the special characteristic of
-ba/-reba, that it's dealing with hypotheticals.</span></p>

Conditionals made clear! Tara, nara</span></h1>

Lesson 32: Conditionals made clear! &nbsp;Tara, nara - how they
really work</a></span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">こんにちは.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Today we are going to complete our
mini-series on conditionals with the conditionals たら and
-nara.</span></p>
<h2 class="c22" id="h.edpz2yt0n59g"><span class=
"c16">たら</span></h2>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">The たら conditional is particularly
easy to form because all we do is form a verb or an adjective into
its た/だ past form, and we know how to do that.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Once we've done that, all we do is
add -ra and we have the conditional ready-made.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span style=
"overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 624.00px; height: 350.67px;">
<img alt="" src="images/image271.jpg" style=
"width: 624.00px; height: 350.67px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);"
title=""></span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">It's no coincidence that たら and だra
are formed on the past, because this is the only conditional that
can be used about past events.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Now, of course, when we are using it
about past events it's not really a conditional, because we are no
longer saying "if...", we are saying "when..." we know that the
condition was fulfilled because it's already happened.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">But what it does is shows that the
event that happened in the past was unexpected or surprising, and
this is because rather than using one of the more regular means of
showing that one event followed another, such as the - て-form or
から, we are using an if-type conditional.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So we are stressing the fact that
what did happen might well not have happened and indeed it might
have been more in line with expectation if it hadn't
happened.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So, if we say "ieに kaettara さくらが
ita," we're saying "when I returned to the house, Sakura was
there," and obviously we're very surprised to find that Sakura is
there.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">She didn't even have a key; she must
have gotten in through the window.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Sakura does that sort of thing
sometimes, you know.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Now, of course, we can also use it
as a true conditional about future events, and when we do that, it
tends to throw stress on what will happen if the condition is
fulfilled, as opposed to -reba, which throws more stress on the
question of whether or not the condition will be fulfilled or even
the fact that it wasn't fulfilled.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span style=
"overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 624.00px; height: 350.67px;">
<img alt="" src="images/image93.jpg" style=
"width: 624.00px; height: 350.67px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);"
title=""></span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And this is perhaps natural, because
just as in its past form たら can mean more-or-less "when"something
takes place as much as "if"it takes place, it certainly can be used
for things that we don't know whether they will be fulfilled or
not.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Most of the conditionals are
interchangeable in many cases, but if we're talking about a
condition which we're fully expecting to be fulfilled, we're really
saying more "when" than "if", we're most likely to use
たら.</span></p>
<h2 class="c22" id="h.ect89hqzidyz"><span class="c16">ったら -
ってば</span></h2>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Another note on the たら and -ba/-reba
is that we sometimes use the forms -ttara and -tteba with a small
tsu before them to indicate exasperation.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So we might say "Sakara-ttara"or
"Sakura-tteba".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And what this literally means is the
construction of "Sakura と ittara"or "Sakura と ieba", in other words
"when you speak of Sakura..." and this is a bit like saying, "Oh,
you"or "when you speak of Sakura, it's always something like this,
isn't it?"</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">It's not flattering, it is critical,
but it's not very strongly so, especially in the case of
-ttara.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">It can be quite humorous or joking
or a kind of friendly exasperation.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">In my experience, -tteba is more
likely to express real exasperation, and it can be put on to the
end of other things than just a person's name.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">For example, we might say "mou
itta-tteba", which is "I've already said that, haven't
I?"</span></p>
<h2 class="c22" id="h.y2a08naddv8n"><span class=
"c16">なら</span></h2>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Now, -nara is really the easiest of
all conditionals to form, because all we ever do is put -nara after
what we say and that turns it into a conditional.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">We can put it after nouns and we can
put it after complete logical clauses.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">It's very comfortable after nouns
and we don't need to use a copula, probably because the -na of
-nara has its roots in the copula itself.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">There are ways of grafting the other
conditionals onto nouns, but I haven't mentioned those, because I
think it would just be unnecessary complication at this
stage.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Generally speaking, all other things
being equal, we're most likely to use -nara with nouns.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Now, a characteristic of -nara is
that more than the others it can be used of present and future
conditions that really aren't in doubt at all.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So, for example, if Sakura is
worried that something may not be possible to her, we might say
"Sakura-nara, 出来る" and that means "If it's Sakura, it will be
possible".</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span style=
"overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 624.00px; height: 350.67px;">
<img alt="" src="images/image203.jpg" style=

title=""></span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Now, of course, we know it's Sakura,
we're talking to Sakura, so what we're really saying is "Since it's
Sakura, it will be possible" and we're using it to reassure Sakura
that we have confidence in her.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">You might ask the way to the
station; you might say, "Ekiは doko です ka?" and someone might reply,
"Eki-nara, asoko です" and that's saying "If it's the station you're
asking for, it's over there."</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Now, of course, there isn't any real
doubt that it is the station you're asking for, so it's more like
"Since it's the station you're asking for, it's over there."In both
these cases there's no doubt.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">In the case of Sakura, we're
expressing confidence in her as a person -- if it was someone else,
it might not be possible, but if it's Sakura, since it's Sakura, it
will be possible.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And with the station, we're really
just confirming that it's the station we're talking
about.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And, as I say, the conditionals are
very often interchangeable, but knowing the special characteristics
of each one helps us to understand exactly what's going on and
which one we might choose ourselves.</span></p>

Lesson 33: Dake, shika, bakari, nomi: making SENSE of Japanese
limiting terms.</a></span></p>

<p class="c0"><span class="c1">こんにちは.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Today we're going to talk about
terms of limitation: "dake", "shika", "ばかり" (we're already covered
"ばかり"in a video of its own, but we're going to look at how it fits
in here) and "nomi".</span></p>

<p class="c0"><span class="c1">A lot of people find these terms

<h2 class="c22" id="h.6koc081xn5gc"><span class=
"c16">だけ</span></h2>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So, let's start with the most basic
word, "dake".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Dake" means "limit".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">We're sometimes told that it means
"only", and in its most basic form of expression "only"is what we
would say in English.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">However, it's important in some of
its other uses to realize that what it actually means is
"limit".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So, if I say "sen'en dake motte いる",
what I'm saying is "I have a thousand yen limit / A thousand yen is
the limit of what I have".</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span style=
"overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 624.00px; height: 350.67px;">

title=""></span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Dake"is a noun, and when we put
"sen'en" behind it, we're using "sen'en" as the modifier to the
noun "dake".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So we're saying I have a limit of a
thousand yen, a thousand yen is all I have.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So that's simple enough.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">We'll come back to "dake"in a
moment.</span></p>
<h2 class="c22" id="h.rn5t6apttfnc"><span class=
"c16">しか</span></h2>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Now let's look at
"shika".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Now, "shika"does confuse people and
that's because they're given the impression that it means the same
thing, more or less, as "dake".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And what it in fact means is the
opposite of "dake".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Shika" means "more
than".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And if we understand that, we'll
never get confused about "shika" because it's very
simple.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">The point is that it's only ever
used in negative sentences.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So, we always have a "ない" or an
"ariません" when we use "shika", so it ends up saying "not more
than".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And this is what makes it very
similar to "dake".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">But if we don't realize that it
actually means "more than", we get very confused about how it fits
into a sentence structurally.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So, if we say "Sen'en dake motte
いる", we're saying a thousand yen is the limit of what I
have.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span style=
"overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 624.00px; height: 350.67px;">

title=""></span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">If we say "Sen'en shika motte inai",
we're saying I don't have any more than a thousand yen.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And as you can see this is a
negative sentence and the stress is on the negative.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">It's very similar to what we might
say in English: we might say "I only have a thousand yen"or we
might say "I don't have any more than a thousand yen".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And you can see the difference
between those two, and the difference is exactly the same in
Japanese.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Dake"doesn't imply that a thousand
yen is a lot or a little; it doesn't imply anything about it, it's
just saying that that's what I have and that's all I
have.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"I don't have any more than a
thousand yen"is putting emphasis on the fact that this might be too
little, or that if you were wanting any more you're not going to
get it, or whatever.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">It has this negative emphasis
because we're putting all the emphasis on what I don't have, not
what I do have.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And that, in this context, is the
difference between "dake" and "shika... nai".</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And "shika... nai"can also be used
in circumstances such as "nigeru shika nai".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Nigeru"is to "run away"or "escape";
if we say "nigeru shika nai" we're saying "there's nothing for it
but to run / There's no other course of action but to
run."</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span style=
"overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 624.00px; height: 350.67px;">

title=""></span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So just as "sen'en shika nai" means
I have nothing more than a thousand yen, "nigeru shika nai" means
there's nothing we can do other than -- or more than --
run.</span></p>
<h2 class="c22" id="h.o2m8j0g8nc9e"><span class=
"c16">だけあって</span></h2>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So now let's go back to some of the
other uses of "dake".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">One of the commonest is "出来る dake",
which means "as much as possible"or "if at all
possible".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Now, you see, at this point, if
we're thinking of "dake" as meaning "only" we can start to get
confused.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Is this a completely different kind
of "dake"? No, it's exactly the same.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"出来る dake" means "to the limit of
possibility".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"出来る dake 勉強 します" -- "I will study
if I can"or "I will study as much as I can"/ "to the limit of the
possibility I will study."</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Another use which you'll certainly
see quite often is "dake あって".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Now this "atte"is "ある"-- to
"be".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And we're often told that it means
something like "not for nothing".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So "ryuugaku shita dake あって eigo は
umai".</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span style=
"overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 624.00px; height: 350.67px;">

title=""></span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And this literally means "because of
the limit of the fact that she studied abroad..." (and the
"because" here is that て-form, which often implies the cause of the
following effect) "... her English is excellent."</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Now the translation we're given is
"Not for nothing did she study abroad, her English is excellent."
but what is actually being said here is "Precisely because and only
because she studied abroad, her English is excellent."</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Now, you might think I'm splitting
hairs here and being a bit too geeky about the exact
meaning.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">But let's take another
example.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">" や sui dake あって sugu ni
kowarechatta."Now, this means "because of the limit of its being
cheap, it quickly broke."</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span style=
"overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 624.00px; height: 350.67px;">

title=""></span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Now, it wouldn't make any sense here
to say, would it, "Not for nothing was it cheap, it broke quickly."
what we're actually saying is "Precisely because it was cheap, it
broke quickly." that "dake"is using the limiting function to limit
something down to something precise.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">If we want to bring in the "only"
aspect of it, the way it works is that what we're saying is "Only
by studying abroad would you get that good at English", "Only
something really cheap would break that quickly."</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So that's how the limitation, the
"only", function of "dake"is actually working here.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">We're using it to give precision to
the statement: "Precisely and only because of this the result
followed" ; "Dake あって" -- "It exists because of and limited to this
fact."</span></p>
<h2 class="c22" id="h.8t1c9ecb6110"><span class=
"c16">ばかり</span></h2>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Now let's bring in "ばかり".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"ばかり", as we know, also expresses
the same kind of limits.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">It means "just such-andすch a
thing".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So let's compare it with the other
two.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">If we say "ano お店 は pan dake uru",
we're saying "that shop only sells bread".</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span style=
"overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 624.00px; height: 350.67px;">

title=""></span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">If we say "ano お店 は pan shika
uranai", we're saying "that shop doesn't sell anything but
bread".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">If we say "ano お店 は pan bakari uru",
we're again saying "that shop only sells bread" but as we know from
the "ばかり"lesson, what we're likely to mean by that is "that shop
sells an awful lot of bread".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">It may not even be true that it only
sells bread, because "ばかり"can be used hyperbolically.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">We can say "toukyou は gaijin bakari
だ" -- "In Tokyo there's nothing but foreigners" which doesn't mean,
any more than it would in English, that there really aren't any
Japanese people in Tokyo.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">It means there are an awful lot of
foreigners in Tokyo.</span></p>
<h2 class="c22" id="h.xaxpsrfx5kan"><span class=
"c16">Comparison</span></h2>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So, we can put these three on a
sliding scale.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span style=
"overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 624.00px; height: 350.67px;">

title=""></span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Pan shika uranai"is implying that
only selling bread is very little, it's insufficient.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Maybe we want something other than
bread but we can't get it.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Pan dake uru"doesn't have any
implication.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">It's neutral.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">It could mean that the shop
specializes in bread and therefore it's very good.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">It could mean, indeed, we can't get
anything if we're wanting something other than bread.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">It doesn't have any particular
implication.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">It's just neutrally saying that the
shop only sells bread.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Pan bakari uru"implies that there's
an awful lot of bread there.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">The fact that it's limited to bread
is essentially making the point that bread is there in abundance to
the extent that we might hyperbolically say that nothing else but
bread is there even though with "ばかり"in fact it could
be.</span></p>
<h2 class="c22" id="h.vesezq302lj9"><span class=
"c16">のみ</span></h2>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And before we end, I'm just going to
cover "nomi".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Nomi"is very easy because all it
means is "dake"in its simplest sense.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So we say "pan dake uru / pan nomi
uru".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">They both mean the same
thing.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">They mean "only sells bread" without
any special implication.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Nomi"is used in formal contexts,
it's mostly used in writing, and unless you're trying to use very
formal Japanese you won't really need to use it.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">The reason it's important to know is
that, for example, if you were going to go into a place and the
sign was telling you that only members are admitted it could save a
lot of embarrassment if you knew that that "nomi" means the same
thing as "dake".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span>And that kind of sign is precisely where they
would use "nomi", because it tends to get used in these formal,
official kinds of context.</span></p>

Lesson 34: Understand any sentence. Powerful analysis
technique.</a></span><span class="c1">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">こんにちは.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Today we are going to discuss the
most fundamental thing in Japanese.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And, if we understand this, we can
understand any Japanese sentence.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">If we don't, we can't.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">It's really as fundamental as
that.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And I introduced this in our very
first lesson, because if we don't have this, we're going
nowhere.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">What we are going to do today is
start talking about how we can apply this to any Japanese sentence
that we find in the wild.</span></p>
<h2 class="c22" id="h.8jskmiafrb81"><span class="c16">The japanese
core sentence</span></h2>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Now, the fundamental core of
Japanese, as you know, is the core Japanese sentence.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">It's what I call the A-car and the
B-engine.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Both of those elements have to be
there in every sentence.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">We can always see the
B-engine.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">We can't always see the A-car, but
it's always there.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span style=
"overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 624.00px; height: 350.67px;">

title=""></span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">In English these are called the
subject and the predicate and in Japanese they are called the 主語
(shugo) and 述語 (jutsugo), but we are going to continue calling them
the A-car and the B-engine because this way we can visualize
exactly what's going on in a sentence by using trains.</span></p>
<h2 class="c22" id="h.an952645jr83"><span class="c16">Conjunctions
connect logical clauses</span></h2>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Now this lesson begins with a
question asked by my Gold Kokeshi patron Pantelis Chrysafis-sama
(and I hope I'm pronouncing your name right).</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">It was a very simple question, but a
very good one, a very fundamental one.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">It was simply, "how do we know where
a logical clause ends?" and that's really the same as the question
"how do we identify a logical clause?". We need to know where it
ends and we need to know where it begins.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">The factors complicating this are
that there can be more than one logical clause in a compound
sentence (but as I'm going to demonstrate, that isn't really as
difficult as it seems) and also the fact that we can't always see
the A-car.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">The other complicating factor is the
fact that we will see the elements of logical clauses and even
complete logical clauses that are not part of the sentence
core.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And if they're not part of the
sentence core, what they are doing is modifying or telling us more
about either the A-car or the B-engine.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span style=
"overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 624.00px; height: 350.67px;">

title=""></span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">That's the only thing they can ever
be doing, because the sentence is its core and everything else in
the sentence is related to and telling us more about that
core.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Now, sentences where there is more
than one logical clause have to be connected by some kind of
conjunction.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And this is very important, because
this gives us the key to seeing whether or not there is more than
one core and if there is, where they are and how they're
working.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span style=

title=""></span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">In our recent series on
conditionals, we were in fact dealing with conjunctions.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">There are various kinds of
conjunction: and, but, when, if, etc.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And the two other kinds of
conjunctions that we need to look out for are the て-form, which can
join two clauses together into a compound sentence, as we looked at
in our first lesson on compound sentences, and the い-stem of a
verb.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">You've seen how the い-stem is the
main conjunctive stem out of the four stems of verbs.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">It can connect nouns to verbs; it
can connect other verbs to verbs; it can connect various helpers to
verbs; and it can also connect one logical clause to
another.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">This is slightly more literary,
slightly more sophisticated, perhaps, than the て-form, but it's the
one other thing you need to look out for when you're investigating
whether there is more than one logical clause in a
sentence.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">We'll talk about this more in a
later lesson.</span></p>
<h2 class="c22" id="h.4mzj6hz3oa8"><span>How to analyze</span></h2>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Now, let's talk about the
complications that can arise and how we can see through them, how
we can use our detective powers to see what's really going
on.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">I'm going to take a simple
conditional sentence that we used before.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"傘を 持ってくれば よかった" which means "I
should have taken an umbrella / I wish I'd taken an
umbrella".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">What it literally means is "If I had
taken an umbrella, it would have been good."</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span style=
"overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 624.00px; height: 350.67px;">

title=""></span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Now, we can see the first logical
clause easily, can't we?</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">That is "傘を 持ってくれば", which is simply
"傘を 持ってくる" -- "bring an umbrella"-- turned into its conditional
form -- "if I bring an umbrella"-- and that's going to be thrown
into the past tense by the final engine in the sentence, which is
the way Japanese works.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So, we have clause one, which is "傘を
持ってくれば".</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">We know that it's a complete clause
and we know it's going to be followed by a second clause because we
have a conjunction there in the form of a conditional.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">But what follows it is simply "よかった"
which is the past tense of いい and it means "good".</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span style=
"overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 624.00px; height: 350.67px;">

title=""></span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Is this a core sentence? Yes, it
is.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">The first sentence is "傘を 持ってくれば";
the second sentence is "(zeroが) よかった".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">We know this because "よかった" is an
engine.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">It's an adjective, it's a describing
word and it has to be describing something.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Wherever you've got an adjective,
the adjective must be describing something.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Wherever you've got a B-engine,
there must be an A-car to correspond to it.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So what is the A-car here? What is
"よかった" describing? What is it telling us "would have been good"?
This is a very important point.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">If we translate it into very literal
English, what we're saying is "If I had brought an umbrella, it
would have been good." and this is exactly what the Japanese
means.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"It" would have been good. The A-car
is "it".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So what is "it"? This is the
important point: "It", or the zero-car, does not have to be clearly
definable, either in English or in Japanese.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">What "it" means here is "the
circumstance / things in general (would have been
good)".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And we do this in Japanese all the
time.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And we do it in English all the
time.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So, for example, if we say in
English "It's sunny, isn't it!"</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">In Japanese we might say "晴れ
だね!".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">They mean the same thing.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span style=
"overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 624.00px; height: 350.67px;">

title=""></span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">In English we have to say "It is
sunny"-- we could say "Sunny, isn't it?" but that's only because
we're leaving out the "it".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And we've still got it at the end,
because we don't ever say "Sunny, isn't!" we say "Sunny, isn't it!"
which must be short for "It is sunny, isn't it!"</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">In Japanese we say "晴れ..." (which
means "sunny" or "clear" in the sense of clear skies): "晴れだね!" Now,
"だ" is the copula.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">It's got to be connecting that "晴れ"
to something else, which is our zero-particle.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">What is it connecting it to? Well,
in this case we don't know.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">It could be the day -- "the day is
sunny".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">It could be the weather -- "the
weather is sunny".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">It could be the sky -- "the sky is
clear"-- because " hare"can mean "clear" as well in that sky
sense.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">It doesn't matter.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">It doesn't matter in Japanese and it
doesn't matter in English what we mean by "it" when we say "If I'd
brought an umbrella, it would have been good" or "It is
sunny".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">But we can't do without
it.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">We can't do without it in Japanese
and we can't do without it in English.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Because in both Japanese and English
we have to have an A-car and a B-engine.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">A subject and a predicate. A shugo
and a jutsugo.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">In English we always have to be able
to see both of them.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">In Japanese we don't need to see the
first one.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">We do need to see the second
one.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">But the first one is always there,
and if we don't understand that we're going to have great
difficulty picking out the core sentence, especially as things get
more complex.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So, to get directly to the question,
how do we find the end of a logical clause?</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Now, the main logical clause, the
head clause of the sentence, is always the last one, and we can
find the end very easily because the end of the logical clause is
the end of the sentence.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">In Japanese, a sentence has to end
with an engine, that is to say, an adjective, a copula ("だ" or
"です") or a verb.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So the last engine in the sentence
will be the end of the head clause of the sentence, the main final
clause of the sentence, always.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">It will be the last thing in the
sentence apart, perhaps, from one or two sentence-ender particles
like "よ" or "ね" or "よね".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">We call them sentence-ender
particles, but in a way it might be more accurate to call them
particles that come after the end of the sentence.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">The final engine is the end of the
logical sentence and the ender particles are just a little add-on
that we put on right after the end of the sentence.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So it's very easy to find the end of
the last logical clause in a sentence or the end of the entire
logical clause if there is only one logical clause in the
sentence.</span></p>
<h2 class="c22" id="h.lu1r5yjk72nw"><span class="c16">Complex
Sentences</span></h2>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">The more difficult question -- but
it's not really all that difficult, but the question that can cause
problems is the question of how do we find or how do we eliminate
the possibility of a compound sentence? How do we know there are no
other logical clauses in the sentence or, if there are, how do we
find them? And the answer to that is again very simple and
straightforward.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">A logical clause will always end
with an engine: a verb, a noun followed by a copula ("だ" -- it
won't be followed by "な", because if the copula "だ" has become "な"
then it must be a modifier, it can't be a logical clause in itself)
-- a noun with the copula "だ" , or an adjective.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And if it is a clause before the
final clause in a compound sentence, it's going to end with a
connector.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">It has to, because it has to connect
to the next logical clause.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So, now what we're going to do is
look at the sort of complex sentence that can confuse people and
we're going to look at how we tackle that sentence.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So the sentence is "私が Sakuraに 話した
日本語が 出来る 留学生は 五輪金 メダルを 獲得した 女性と 結婚した."</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span style=

title=""></span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Now, as you can see, that looks
pretty complicated.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">How do we go about it, how do we go
about analyzing it? Jay Rubin-先生, for whom I have great respect,
suggests that if we're really stuck we should work backwards
through a Japanese sentence.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And there's some sense in that,
because Japanese sentences do in a certain way and up to a certain
point run in reverse order from an English sentence.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">However, we can only do that with
written sentences.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">We can't do it with spoken sentences
because people won't speak backwards for us most of the
time.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">However, one thing I do think is
useful if you're feeling particularly stuck with a sentence is to
make sure you've got the head verb or the head copula or the head
adjective, whatever is the head of the sentence, in your
mind.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So if we just take a peek at that
first so we know where we're going to.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And the head of this sentence is
very straightforward, isn't it? It's "結婚した".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">The head verb is simply "した" --
"did"-- but that's making a する-verb with "結婚"; so,
"結婚した".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">What the sentence is telling us is
that somebody got married.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">All right.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">But now let's do what I think we
should do so long as we can, and most of the time we really can --
Start from the beginning. All right.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So, the first part of the sentence,
the first clause: "私が Sakuraに 話した"</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Now, that could be a complete
logical sentence in itself, couldn't it?</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"I spoke to Sakura."</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Or it could be "I told Sakura" in
which case it couldn't be complete in itself, could it? Because I
would have to tell her something.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Now, which is it in this case? Well,
we know that's it's not a complete logical clause, "I spoke to
Sakura." why not? Because it's not ending in any kind of
conjunction, is it? It's followed directly by a noun,
"日本語".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">There's no conjunctive word, there's
no て-form and it's not the い-stem of "話す".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So we know that this is in fact a
modifier for something else.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So, what have we got next? "日本語が
出来る"-- now, that means "Japanese is possible".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"日本語が 出来る"could be a complete
sentence in itself, couldn't it? " to me, Japanese is possible."
the "to me" would be implicit, but that's fine, we do that all the
time.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">But we know it isn't because it
doesn't end in any kind of conjunction.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So this also can't be a complete
logical clause within a compound sentence.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">It must be a modifier for
something.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And what we expect it to be a
modifier for would be a person: a person to whom Japanese is
possible.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And that's exactly what we get next:
"留学生".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"留学生" is an exchange student,
usually from a foreign country.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So, "日本語が 出来る" modifies "留学生" -- "an
exchange student to whom Japanese is possible / a Japanese-speaking
exchange student." and "私が Sakuraに 話した" is modifying all
that.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"the Japanese-speaking exchange
student who I told Sakura about" and then that's followed by は
.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Now, "留学生は" indicates it's very
likely, isn't it, that this is going to be the topic of the
sentence and that the topic of the sentence is going to be the
doer, the A-car of the sentence.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">But let's continue the sentence and
see if that seems to be the case.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span style=
"overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 624.00px; height: 350.67px;">

title=""></span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">We now have "五輪金 メダル" and that means
an Olympic gold medal.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"五輪" means "five
circles".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"五輪金"-- which is gold -- "メダル"-- an
Olympic gold medal -- "を 獲得した".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Now that is not, that can't be a
logical sentence because it's not a logical sentence, is it? It's
not a logical sentence without a doer, and there's no doer implied
here.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">But we have the doer right
afterwards, don't we? So we know that we have here a modifier for
another noun, not a logical sentence in itself: "五輪金 メダルを 獲得した
女性".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So now we have another modified
noun: "a woman who won an Olympic gold medal".</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span style=

<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And now we've come to the head-verb
of the sentence: "と 結婚した".</span></p>

<p class="c0"><span class="c1">We have the A-car, which is the
exchange student who can speak Japanese that I told Sakura about,
married a woman who won an Olympic gold medal.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And as you see, we've got various
actions going on in this sentence; we've got various things that
could, under different circumstances, form logical clauses of their
own, but none of them actually can.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span style=

<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">We now know that this is not a
compound sentence.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">This is one rather complex sentence
with a single A-car and a single B-engine.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Where a logical clause ends is
either at the end of the sentence or before a
conjunction.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And if you can do that, you can
analyze just about any Japanese sentence, however complicated it
looks, and see what's going on in the sentence.</span></p>

<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And abstract words all have their
base in physical metaphors, even if we sometimes forget the
physical metaphor, and with words like this, it's useful to begin
by understanding the original literal meaning and then seeing how
the metaphor works.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So "yori" means "from", and we
already have another word meaning "from", don't we? And that's
から.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Now, there is a difference between
the two, which is particularly pronounced as we start to apply them
metaphorically.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span style=
"overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 624.00px; height: 350.67px;">

title=""></span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">からmarks the "a"in "a from B"in such
a way that it is treating "a" as the starting point or point of
origin.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So, if I say "Nihon kara kiました", I'm
saying "I came (or come) from Japan / Japan is my point of
origin."</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And this in a way is midway between
the literal, physical meaning and the metaphorical meaning, because
it can mean literally I just came on a plane from Japan or it can
imply that I'm Japanese or that I was raised in Japan or something
like that.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">When we move to its purely
metaphorical meaning, it usually means "because".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">In other words, "a"is the point of
origin of "b".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Samui kara ko と を kいる" -- "because
it's cold, I wear a coat"/ "From the fact that it's cold, I'm
wearing a coat."</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Now, "yori" means "from"in a very
different sense.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">The directional metaphor is
concentrating not on the origin of A from B, but in the distance or
difference of A from B. So, if we say "Sakuraは Meari yori きれい だ"
we're saying that "from Mary"Sakura is pretty.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span style=

title=""></span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">What we mean by this is that,
distinguished from Mary, Sakura is pretty.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Now, it does have something in
common with から because we're still using Mary as the base point,
the point of comparison.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And because of this, because it has
a comparative meaning, we're not saying Sakura is pretty but Mary
isn't.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">We're saying that, taking Mary as
the point of comparison, Sakura is pretty -- therefore, more
pretty, prettier.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">In comparison to Mary, going
"from"Mary, Sakura is pretty.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And you notice here that we said
just what that first sentence, "Meari yori Sakura の houが きれい だ,"
was saying and we didn't need " hou".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">It works perfectly well to say
exactly the same thing without that " hou".</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And we use "yori"in other
contexts.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">For example, we may say "今年 の fuyuは
itsumo yori samui," which literally means "Comparing from always,
this year's winter is cold"or "this year's winter is colder than
always."</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span style=
"overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 624.00px; height: 350.67px;">

title=""></span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And what that actually means is
"this year's winter is colder than usual, colder than most other
years."So that "always"is a kind of hyperbole, in a way.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Similarly, we can say "Sakuraは hito
yori kashikoi" -- "Sakura is clever compared to people." and what
that means, again, is "Sakura is clever compared to most people /
Sakura is clever compared to people in general"-- in other words,
is cleverer "than" the average person.</span></p>
<h2 class="c22" id="h.upvzxu2tyd3n"><span class=
"c16">ほう</span></h2>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">All right, so now let's look at "
hou".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">" hou"is quite different.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">It's not a particle, it's a
noun.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">That's why we have "no
hou".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And its literal meaning is a
"direction"or a "side".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And when we say "side", we mean
"side"in the sense of "direction", not in the sense of
"edge".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So, for example, if we talk about
two sides of a field with " hou", we're not meaning the two edges
of the field, we're meaning that we divide it approximately in half
and we talk about "the left side" and "the right side"of the
field.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Now, as we see from this analogy,
one side always implies the other side.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And that's the important thing about
" hou"in its metaphorical uses.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">In its literal use, when I'm cycling
in Japan, I might say to a stranger, pointing in the direction I'm
going in, "それは Honmachi の hou kou です ka?" and that's saying "Is
that the direction of Honmachi?"I'm not asking for street
directions, which I can't understand in English, or Japanese, or
any other language.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">I'm asking for the literal
direction: "Is Honmachi that way, or am I going in the opposite
direction?"-- which I often am, because I am " hou kou onchi",
which means I have no sense of direction.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So when we apply it metaphorically,
we mean one thing or circumstance or whatever as opposed to
another.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">We can put it after a noun with -no,
as we do with Sakura: "Sakura の hou", or we can put it after a verb
or an adjective, in which case that verb or adjective is describing
the " hou", telling us what kind of a " hou"it is, which "side"it
is.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So, if you say to me "Meariが きれい だ
to 思う?" -- "Do you think Mary is pretty?"-- and I reply "さくらの houが
きれい だ" , I'm saying "the side of Sakura is pretty"-- in other
words, I think Sakura is prettier.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span style=
"overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 624.00px; height: 350.67px;">

title=""></span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Once again, it's a comparative
construction, so I'm not saying Sakura is pretty and Mary isn't,
but I am saying that the side of Sakura is prettier than the other
side, which is Mary.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And, once again, let's notice that
we don't need "yori" here.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"さくらの houが きれい だ" works perfectly
happily on its own to mean exactly the same thing.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And a lot of the time you're going
to see either "yori"or "no hou"on their own.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">We do sometimes use the two together
and when we're doing that we're either speaking fairly formally or
we're really trying to underline the point of the difference and
comparison between the two.</span></p>
<h2 class="c22" id="h.j4cdwwhyy8kv"><span class=
"c16">一方</span></h2>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Another case in which we see "
hou"is in the expression "ippou", which means "one
side".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And we can see this often used in
narrative, sometimes right at the beginning of a sentence -- not
just a sentence, but a paragraph, and indeed a whole section of the
story.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And what it's doing when we do this
is it's saying essentially what we mean in English when we say
"meanwhile".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">But we shouldn't say that "ippou"
means "meanwhile", because it doesn't.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Meanwhile"is a time expression.
It's saying "at the same time".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Ippou", while performing the same
function, does it quite differently.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">What we say when we say "ippou"
before going into something else, is really referring back to what
we were talking about before, whatever that was.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And we're saying "all that was on
one side; and now we're going to look at the other side."It's like
"でも" , which wraps up whatever it was went before with "で" which is
the て-form of "です" -- "all that was, all that existed" -- "も"gives
us the contrasting conjunction: "でも" -- "but".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And we've talked about that in a
different video lesson, haven't we?</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Ippou"should probably, strictly
speaking, be "ippou de"; however, because it's a common expression,
as is often the case with common expressions, we are allowed to
drop that copula.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So, if we say that King Koopa
(that's Bowser) was completing his preparations for the wedding
ceremony with Princess Peach, and then we say "ippou"Mario's
jumping up blocks on his way to rescue the princess.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So on the one side, that's what's
happening with Bowser in Bowser Castle; on the other side, this is
what's happening with Mario in the Mushroom Kingdom.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">We can also use "ippou" as a
conjunction.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And essentially this is working just
the same way as the "ippou" which means "meanwhile".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">It's taking one side, and then the
other side, so it's a contrastive conjunction.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So we might say "kono atariは 静か na
ippou de fuben だ" - "It's quiet around here, but it's inconvenient
/ on the one hand, it's quiet around here, but it's
inconvenient."</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span style=

title=""></span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Literally that "kono atariは 静か na"
(which of course is "静か だ" in its connective form) .. "this area is
quiet"-- and all that is a descriptor for "ippou": "静か na
ippou".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"One side is that around here is
quiet."So, we're describing the one side, the "ippou de" and then
"で", that's the copula -- "One side is that it's quiet, and the
other side is..." (but we don't actually say "but the other side
is", that's already implied) -- "One side is that it's quiet, it's
inconvenient." and that "ippou de" acts as the
conjunction.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And we can, once again, leave off
the copula here.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">One other use of "ippou" that we
should mention is that it can also be used after a complete verbal
clause to show that something that is happening is continuing in
one direction.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span style=

title=""></span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">For example, we might say "kono mura
の jinkouが heru ippou だ" -- "this village's population is just
declining and declining / ... just goes on declining."</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span>"Kono mura の jinkouが heru" means "this
village's population is declining" and the "ippou"is telling us
that it just continues on in that one direction: it never grows, it
never stays still, it just declines and declines.</span></p>

Lesson 36: Tokoro- the Japanese concept of Place - Grammar
Magic</a></span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">こんにちは.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Today we're going to talk about the
concept of "place"in everyday Japanese, because this is something
that often confuses people, and I've seen even quite good amateur
translators getting it wrong.</span></p>
<h2 class="c22" id="h.k6w3rgiw5iax"><span class=
"c16">ところ</span></h2>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">The word for "place"in Japanese is,
of course, "ところ", and we learn this from quite early on. It means a
literal place and it quickly takes on slightly metaphorical
uses.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">For example, we can say "私 の ところ",
which means "my apartment or house / the place where I
live".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Come and hang out at my place."In
English, that doesn't mean " hang out" as in " hang out of the
window". It means… oh, forget it, English is too
complicated.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">However, in Japanese, the figurative
sense of "place"goes a lot further than it goes in
English.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">For example, if I say "Sakura の
dokoが 好き nano?"</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span style=
"overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 624.00px; height: 350.67px;">
<img alt="" src="images/image349.jpg" style=
"width: 624.00px; height: 350.67px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);"
title=""></span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">I'm asking, literally "Sakura's
where do you like?"or "what place of Sakura do you
like?"</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Now, if I ask this, I'm not
expecting an answer like "I like her left ear."</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">An appropriate answer might be
something like " や sashii だ" -- "She's gentle / What I like about
her is that she's gentle / The place I like about her is that she's
gentle."</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And we might say "this is, in my
opinion, Sakura's ii ところ'" -- "Sakura's good place or one of
Sakura's good places".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So "place" here doesn't mean
anything remotely like a physical location.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">It means an aspect of something,
even a really abstract something like a person's
personality.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">If I listen to a complicated
lecture, someone might say to me "wakariました ka?" -- "Did you
understand it?"-- and I might reply "分かる ところが attaが wakaranai
ところ-mo ariました" -- "there were places I understood and places I
didn't understand."</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span style=
"overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 624.00px; height: 350.67px;">
<img alt="" src="images/image198.jpg" style=

title=""></span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And here, as you see, this is closer
to a usage we might have in English: "I mostly understood it, but
there were places that I didn't understand."</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">This could lead to a subtle
misunderstanding in that what I'm most likely to be saying in
Japanese is not that there were times during the lecture when I
didn't understand, but there were aspects or subtleties that I
wasn't quite grasping.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So, especially if you're more
advanced, it's good to be aware of this metaphorical depth of the
concept of "place".</span></p>
<h2 class="c22" id="h.r2mvmk6lgqjx"><span>V [Plain form] +
ところ</span></h2>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Now, "place"is also often used to
mean a place not in space but in time.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And if we understand this analogy,
we can understand certain usages that are often explained without
explaining the structural underpinning for them, which ends up by
just giving you a list of things to memorize and as usual say
"well, this goes with this and happens to mean that and we don't
particularly know why."</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So, for example, we can use "ところ" --
"place"-- with "a does B"sentences in all three tenses, that's to
say, the past, the present, and the future.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span style=
"overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 624.00px; height: 350.67px;">

title=""></span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So, for example, if we say, using
the plain dictionary form of the word "食べる" -- "eat" (which, as we
know, from our lesson on tenses is not present by default; it's
future by default).</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">If we say " hいるgohan を 食べる ところ だ" ,
what we're saying is "I'm just about to eat lunch."</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span style=
"overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 624.00px; height: 350.67px;">

title=""></span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">What's the structure of this? Well,
it ends with "だ" , so we know that what we have is an "a is
B"sentence, even though the original sentence sandwiched into it is
an "a does B"sentence.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So we're saying that "(something) is
place".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">The zero-car here is "it", as it
would be in English, and what it means is the present time, exactly
as it does in English when we say "It's time to leave" -- "the
present time is time to leave". The "it"is "the present time"in
both Japanese and English in these constructions.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So, we're saying "It (the present
time) is I-will-eat-lunch time", so what it means is "I'm just
about to eat lunch".</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So how putting "ところ だ" onto this
sentence changes it from what it would mean if we just said "
hいるgohan を 食べる" is that it's telling us that we are right now at
that place where I'm going to eat lunch, therefore I'm just about
to eat lunch. Not I'm going to eat lunch possibly in half-an-hour.
I'm just about to eat lunch right now. This is the place where I'm
just about to eat lunch. " hいるgohan を 食べる ところ だ."</span></p>
<h2 class="c22" id="h.bq8yx6davnat"><span class="c16">V [ている] +
ところ</span></h2>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Now, if we use it with the actual
present, the continuous present, which is what we use when we're
actually saying we're doing something right at this moment, so we
say " hいるgohan を 食べて いる ところ だ" , what we're saying is "I'm eating
lunch right now." and just as with the previous example, what that
"ところ だ" is doing is making it immediate.</span></p>

<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Now, in the past, if we say "

title=""></span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">The "ところ だ" is adding to that past
tense the immediateness: "the place in time that we're at now is
the place where I ate lunch / I just ate lunch."</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Now, in this case we could say "
hいるgohan を 食べた bakari" - "I just ate lunch." the two mean pretty
much the same thing.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And I've seen textbooks giving us
this set of rules : "You can use bakari with a noun.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">You can say "Kono お店は pan bakari
uru" -- "this shop sells nothing but bread"-- or we can say "
hirogohan を 食べた bakari だ" -- "I just ate lunch." but you have to
remember that the rules say that "ところ"can't be used with a
noun."Now, this is true, but it's a strangely abstract way of
putting it.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">It's putting it as if these are just
some random rules that somebody made up, perhaps in the Heian era
because they had nothing better to do with their time.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">In fact, if we understand the logic
of it, we don't even need to be told this, because it's
obvious.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span style=

<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">I can say either "I just ate
lunch"or I can say "I'm at the place where I've eaten
lunch".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">We can say "this shop just sells
bread", but "this shop bread place sells"doesn't make any sense at
all, does it?</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And this is why I think it's so
important to learn structure. People sometimes say to me "am I
supposed to be working out all this structure you teach in every
sentence I speak or read?" and of course the answer to that is
"の".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">What you're supposed to be doing is
getting used to Japanese by reading, listening, and preferably
speaking too.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">If you're not doing that, you'll
never get used to the grammar however many textbooks you
study.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">But if you understand the structure
you won't be confused by things like whether you can use "ところ" with
a noun or not, and why can't you use "ところ" with a noun when you can
use "ばかり" with a noun, and you have to think all that
out.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">You don't have to do that because
you understand how it's actually working.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">This is what the textbooks could
usefully be teaching, but they don't.</span></p>
<h2 class="c22" id="h.sevtkfbeog5s"><span class=
"c16">とこ</span></h2>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Now, having learned the structure,
it's also important to be aware of the times when bits of the
structure can get left off.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">As with many regular set
expressions, the copula "だ" can be left off, and more than this,
even the end of "ところ"can be left off.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">The "ro"can be left off and we can
just say "toko".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">This is the case in all languages,
that there are places where, colloquially, we can leave bits out.
And so long as we know what the structure is, it's not very
difficult to understand the omissions too.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So, we might say "Nago や に
chakurikushita toko" -- "I just landed at Nago や ." and we often
use these abbreviations like "toko"-- leaving off the "ro" and the
"だ" from "ところ だ" -- when we are trying to express a sense of
immediacy.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">But people do it on various
occasions, just as they do the equivalent thing in
English.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So, we see that "ところ"can be literal,
a "place in space".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">It can express very abstract
concepts like an "aspect of someone's personality", and it can very
often mean a "place in time".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And it can be used in various ways
as a place in time; for example, if someone says "ii ところに kita,
ne?" that is most likely to mean "You came at a good time, didn't
you?"not "You came to a good place, didn't you?" although in fact
it can mean either.</span></p>

Lesson 37: Dominate Japanese Text! New structure secrets + "na vs
no, naru & taru adjectives"</a></span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">こんにちは.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Today we're going to go a little
deeper into Japanese structure.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">But perhaps unexpectedly, that's
going to make things even simpler than we might have thought they
were. And it's going to make it much easier to look at a page of
Japanese and, even when it looks very complicated, have a much
clearer idea of what the elements are and how they're likely to fit
together.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">You may have noticed that I map
sentences very often using trains, and you may have noticed also
that we have a relatively small number of carriage
types.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span style=
"overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 624.00px; height: 350.67px;">

title=""></span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">We have the three engines: the verb
engine, the adjective engine, and the noun-plus-copula
engine.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And we have the various cars, all of
which represent nouns with their various attached logical
particles, which tell us what the nouns are doing in the
sentence.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Now, this relatively small number of
cars actually boils down to only three types of word.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">We have the i-engine, which is
adjectives, we have the u-engine, which is verbs, and everything
else is a noun. We have the noun-plus-copula engine and we have the
various noun carriages with their different particles.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And we may notice that I haven't
introduced an adverb car, and that's because most adverbs -- not
all but most -- are in fact variants on an adjective or variants on
a noun.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">There are a few genuine other kinds
of word, but most of what you see in Japanese is going to boil down
to one of these three, despite what the dictionaries will sometimes
tell you.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And if it's not a verb or an
adjective, then it's likely to be a noun.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">What the dictionaries call
な-adjectives are nouns, what they call no-adjectives are nouns,
what they call する verbs are nouns. And most of the things that they
put into other categories -- not all but most -- turn out to be
nouns.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Japanese is a very noun-centric
language.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">We could be tempted to attribute
this fact to the fact that there are a lot of foreign words in
Japanese and all of them are nouns.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">A great part of the Japanese
vocabulary comes from Chinese.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span style=
"overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 624.00px; height: 350.67px;">

title=""></span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">There are also words from English
and German and other languages, but they pale into insignificance
compared to the older Chinese vocabulary in Japanese, which is
similar to the large amount of the English vocabulary which is
Latin, either directly from Latin or indirectly via
French.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">The difference is that, as I've
said, in Japanese everything that comes from any language other
than native Japanese comes in as a noun.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And I said that we might be tempted
to attribute to that the noun-centric nature of Japanese, but in
fact, I would say it's the other way around. It's because Japanese
is so fundamentally noun-centric that it seems natural to import
anything into the language as a noun.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Once it comes in as a noun, if we
want to use it in the manner of a verb or in the manner of an
adjective, there are ways of doing this.</span></p>
<h2 class="c22" id="h.eem5janjgefn"><span class="c16">する Verbs
nouns</span></h2>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And we're somewhat familiar with
those ways, aren't we? When a noun comes in from Chinese, if we
want to use it as a verb, we turn it into what the dictionaries
call a "する verb".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And in this one case I have no
quarrel with the dictionaries.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"する verb"is a real thing, but this
is an exception because in nearly all other cases where a noun
comes in, it stays a noun even when it's used for a different
purpose.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So, let's start by looking at する
verbs.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">They're very simple.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span style=
"overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 624.00px; height: 350.67px;">
<img alt="" src="images/image49.jpg" style=

title=""></span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">If we take the word "勉強"from
Chinese, which comes in as the noun meaning "the act of studying",
we can say "勉強 を する", which means to "do the act of studying", but
we can also glue the words directly together and say "勉強する", which
means "study".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">We have, in effect, by welding
"する"onto the noun turned the combination into a true
verb.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So, in this particular case, we can
say that a noun came in from Chinese and really became naturalized
as a する verb.</span></p>
<h2 class="c22" id="h.w4aquy38g7i7"><span class="c16">Adjectival
nouns</span></h2>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">However, if we want to use a noun as
an adjective, let's say the noun "きれい", which means "prettiness"or
"cleanness", it never stops being a noun.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span style=
"overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 624.00px; height: 350.67px;">

title=""></span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">The dictionaries and textbooks tell
us about "な-adjectives", but the word is really
nonsense.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">There is no such thing as a
な-adjective.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">There is an adjectival noun which
continues to act in almost every respect like any other
noun.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">The only difference between an
adjectival noun and any other noun is that we can use "na" with
it.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And "na", as we know, is simply the
connective form of "だ".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So, we can say "女の子は きれい だ" -- "the
child is pretty"-- or we can say "きれい-na 女の子", which means "pretty
child".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"きれい だ" means "is pretty" and
"きれい-na" also means "is pretty", so we're saying "child is
pretty"or "is-pretty child".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Na" and "だ" are the same
copula.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Now, the reason these are called
adjectival nouns is that we can't do this exact thing with other
nouns.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">But we can do something very close,
and we'll come to that very shortly.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">But I'll just note before passing on
that we can say that there are essentially two types of adjectival
noun, and that is, the ones like "きれい", which really are not used
as ordinary nouns at all; they're almost entirely dedicated to
being adjectival: we don't talk about a person's "きれい", and then
there are the ones which continue to work as independent nouns,
like "genki".</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span style=
"overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 624.00px; height: 350.67px;">

title=""></span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So we can say "子供が 元気 だ" -- "the
child is lively"; we can say "元気な 子供" -- "lively child".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">But we can also say things like
"genki を daして", which loosely translated means "cheer up", but
literally translated means "get out your genki".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Genki"is a thing here: it's marked
by the を particle, and you can't put a logical particle onto
anything but a noun.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So, "genki", even though it's
primarily adjectival and is classed as an adjectival noun, works as
both an adjectival and a noun.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Now, if a noun is not classed as an
adjectival noun we can still use it adjectivally.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So, the word "mahou", which means
"magic", can be used as a noun just as it can in
English.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">We can talk about magic as a
thing.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">But we can also say "mahou の boushi"
-- "magic hat".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">It's not an adjectival noun, but as
you see, we can achieve pretty much the same effect just by using
"の"instead of "na".</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">There are also some words that can
be either no- or na-adjectivals.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">A good example of this is "fushigi",
which means a "mystery"or a "wonder".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">It tends to get used very often as
an adjective as in "fushigi-na や shiki" -- "mysterious mansion"--
but it's also used quite often as a noun.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">We can talk about the school "nana
fushigi"-- which means literally the ''seven wonders'' or "seven
mysteries"of the school, and what it usually refers to is in fact
ghost stories connected to the school, such as "toire の
Hanako-san", who you may have heard of -- the girl who haunts the
lavatory.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Now, "fushigi", if we're using it
adjectivally, it can be what the dictionaries call either a
"な-adjective"or a "no-adjective", that is to say, we can use either
"na"or "の" when we're using it adjectivally.</span></p>

<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Now, it could have been called

much more appropriate title and a much better translation of the

<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Fushigi-na kuni の アリス" would mean
"Alice of the mysterious country", to say literally "Alice of the
mysterious-is country".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Fushigi の kuni の アリス"implies more
"Alice of the country of wonders".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">We're leaving "fushigi"more as a
noun in itself and attributing it to the country.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">It's a subtle difference, but it's
one that's worth bearing in mind, especially where there is a
choice between the two.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">But the most important thing to bear
in mind is that whether a noun is an adjectival noun or an ordinary
noun being used as an adjective with "の", it's always going to
function as a noun.</span></p>
<h2 class="c22" id="h.cx9kwp8vtij6"><span class="c16">なる Adjectives
nouns</span></h2>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Now, the dictionaries also like to
mix things up by telling us that there are other kinds of adjective
too; they're less common, but there are "なる-adjectives" and
"taru-adjectives", and what on earth do these mean and what's the
story about them? Well, the truth is that they again are simply
nouns.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So, if we take a book that my little
sister likes… it's called "アリス to Pengin: karei- なる tantei", which
means "Alice and Penguin: The Magnificent Detectives".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Actually, "karei"is an adjectival
noun, so we can use it with "na", but in this case the author has
chosen to use "なる" instead. What does "なる"mean here? Is it the "なる"
that means "become"? No, it isn't.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">It's a contraction of "no
aru".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And as I have explained in another
video, "の"can be used in place of "ga"in adjectival phrases. And
I've explained why that is in the other video.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span style=

title=""></span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So "karei- なる tantei" means "きれい の
aru tantei" which means "きれいが aru tantei" which means "detectives
possessing 'karei'".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">What is "karei"? Well, it's
"splendor"or "magnificence".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">The author actually supplies an
English translation, although the book is entirely in Japanese, of
the title: "Alice and Penguin: The Excellent
Detectives".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">But I would say this is not a very
good translation into English.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Karei" means something more than
"excellent", but even more than that, the choice of "なる"rather than
"na"-- what does that mean? Does that have an implication, like the
one in "Fushigi の Kuni の アリス"?</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">I would say it could have done, in
the past, up to a certain point, but with a modern text, making the
choice to use "なる" has a different meaning. It's being chosen
because it sounds a bit more old-fashioned, a bit more literary, a
bit more somehow portentous.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Therefore, in English I would choose
the rather overblown term "magnificent", because "karei"is in fact
quite an overblown word to use in the first place and choosing to
use "なる" with it blows it up even further.</span></p>
<h2 class="c22" id="h.ys3i99joyj3p"><span class="c16">たる Adjectives
nouns</span></h2>
<p class="c0"><span>" t</span><span class="c1">aru", which is also
sometimes used, is a contraction of "to aru", so that "ある" is
actually being attributed to the thing being described rather than
to the thing that's describing it.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">It's saying that the thing being
described exists in the way implied by the noun that it's using as
a descriptor.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span style=
"overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 624.00px; height: 350.67px;">

title=""></span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">In practice, the difference isn't
huge, but it's worth bearing that in mind just to see what the
subtler implications might be.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">But the point here is that we're
playing with a very small number of elements. We have verbs and we
have adjectives and most of what is not one of those is simply
going to be a noun. Even if it works as an adverb, it's going to be
fundamentally either a noun or an adjective.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And an important thing to bear in
mind, because every word that's imported from Chinese is a noun, if
we see a word that is made up of kanji without any okurigana,
without any attached hiragana, we know that that word is almost
certain to be a noun.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So, understanding the noun-centric
structure of Japanese makes it easier for us to see what's going on
when we look at a page of Japanese.</span></p>
<h2 class="c22" id="h.fq88pshyxn43"><span class="c16">Groups of
Kanji</span></h2>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">One thing that can be confusing,
however, is the fact that we will sometimes see groups of kanji
sitting together with no kana in between them.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">What's going on on these occasions?
We know that free-standing kanji are going to be nouns, so when we
see a lot of them together, what's happening? Well, what's
happening is that one noun is modifying another.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">We've seen the ways in which nouns
modify each other with "na"or "の"or even "なる"or "taru", but they
can also modify each other with nothing, and we're already familiar
with that where two words glue together to make another word, such
as "日本語".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Nihon"is "Japan", "go"is
"language", and if you put the two together you have "日本語" --
"Japanese language".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Now, we see that in many, many
cases, some of which we've already covered. And this works exactly
the same way as in English. For example, in English we have words
like "bookshelf" and "seaweed".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">In Japanese we can do exactly the
same thing.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span style=
"overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 624.00px; height: 350.67px;">
<img alt="" src="images/image258.jpg" style=
"width: 624.00px; height: 350.67px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);"
title=""></span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So we have " 本棚 " -- " hon"is
"book", "dana"is "shelf": " 本棚 "is "bookshelf".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Kaisou" -- "買い" is the on-reading
of "umi", "sea" ; "そう"is the on-reading of "kusa", "grass", and
together they make "kaisou" -- "seaweed", because "grass"can mean
any kind of plant-life, which is why we have Grass
Pokemon.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And this also happens in the case of
combinations that don't exist in English, such as
"yubiwa".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Yubi"is "finger", "wa"is a "ring",
so "yubiwa"is a finger ring.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">However, we can see larger
combinations too, for things that would be phrases rather than
words in English. And again this is done in exactly the same way as
it happens in English, so it should really be no cause for
alarm.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">For example, we have "daigaku kyou
行く" -- "daigaku" means "university" ; "kyou 行く" means "education"or
"training".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So "daigaku kyou 行く"is "university
education".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And, as you see, again it works
exactly the same way as in English. We don't need, in English, to
say "education at a university"every time; we can say "university
education".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And in Japanese we can say "daigaku
kyou 行く", and we don't need any "na"or "の"or anything else to join
them. They create a commonly used phrase on their own.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">We can't do this every time. It's
like adjectival nouns.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">There are certain expressions where
this is known and accepted and certain kinds of construction where
this is frequently done.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Now, we may see longer blocks of
kanji which can look very daunting until you understand what they
are, how they work and what they're likely to be. It's often done
in the case of institutions and things like that.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">For example, "日本語 nouryoku
shiken".</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span style=
"overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 624.00px; height: 350.67px;">
<img alt="" src="images/image223.jpg" style=
"width: 624.00px; height: 351.00px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: -0.17px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);"
title=""></span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Now, that looks quite a daunting
block of kanji perhaps, when you're not familiar with the
idea.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">But what this actually is is the
Japanese Language Proficiency Test, which you've probably heard of
and of which I'm not a great advocate.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And we can see that exactly the same
thing is happening in Japanese as in the English equivalent: "日本語"
-- "Japanese language" ; "nouryoku" -- "proficiency"or "ability" ;
"shiken" -- "examination".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And exactly as in English we can use
one noun to modify another noun and then the two of them together
to modify the third noun -- and so on.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So, "nihon"modifies "go" (what kind
of a language? Japanese language).</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"日本語"modifies "nouryoku" (what kind
of proficiency? Japanese language proficiency).</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And then all of it modifies "shiken"
(what kind of exam? A Japanese language proficiency
exam).</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So even when you see kanji piled up
in this way, there's no need to panic.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span>Just take a breath and see what it's all made
up of.</span></p>

Lesson 38: Know when "it isn't" means "it is": mysteries of じゃない
janai, ではない de wa nai</a></span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">こんにちは.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Today we're going to talk about
something that puzzles many learners of Japanese, especially once
they've learned a little Japanese and they start reading Japanese
or listening to anime etc.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And this is the fact that Japanese
people often make what appear to be negative statements when they
may mean in fact a positive statement.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">For example, someone may say "Sakura
janai", which would appear to mean "that isn't Sakura." but its
actual meaning is "that is Sakura, isn't it?"or even simply "that
is Sakura".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Now, how does this work, how do we
recognize it, and how do we understand it?</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">For a start, "janai"is the
contraction of "deは nai" which, of course, is the negative of the
copula, as we learned right back in our lesson on Japanese
negatives.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So, "a,B だ" or "a,B です" means "a is
B".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">" a,B deは ない (or deは ariません)" means
"a is not B".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So there is no question here that we
are in fact hearing what is, grammatically, a negative
statement.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So how do we interpret this? Well,
to begin with, let's remind ourselves of the fact that negative
questions are used in most languages, including English, to elicit
a positive response.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So if we say "It's a nice day, isn't
it?" we mean that it is a nice day and we expect our hearer to
agree.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">If we say "are you Sakura?" this is
a neutral question. We're not suggesting that we either think it is
or it isn't. We're simply asking the question.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">But if we say "aren't you Sakura?"
then we are in fact indicating that we think you are
Sakura.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And a negative question asking for a
positive response like "It's a nice day, isn't it?"is common
certainly to all the languages I know.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">In French we have "n'est-ce pas", in
German we have "nicht wahr", and of course in Japanese we have
"ne", which is originally a negative question.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So if we say "Sakura jaない です ka?"
we're saying exactly the same thing as in English "Isn't that
Sakura?"meaning we think it is.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">The first problem that arises here
is that, while we say in formal speech "Sakura jaない です ka" because
in formal speech the "ka" acts as a verbal question mark, turning
any statement into a question, we don't usually use "ka" as a
question-making sentence-ender in ordinary, non-formal
Japanese.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So what would be "Sakura jaない です
ka"in formal Japanese becomes "Sakura janai"in regular
Japanese.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Sakura janai" has fundamentally
three potential meanings.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">We can say "Sakura janai"-- that
means "that isn't Sakura".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">We can say "Sakura janai" and that
means "that's Sakura, isn't it?"</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">But we can also say, perhaps meeting
Sakura after quite a long time, "Sakura janai", and that certainly
doesn't mean it isn't Sakura and it's not a question
either.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">We've actually recognized her and
what we're saying is something that could perhaps best be rendered
into English as "If it isn't Sakura!"meaning it is
Sakura.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Now there's nothing particularly
mystical and Japanese about this.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">We do the same sort of thing in
English.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">For example, if we said "She came on
Saturday", that's simply conveying a piece of
information.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">If we say "She came on Saturday?"
we're asking whether she came on Saturday or not.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And if we say "She came on
Saturday?!" we've just received the information that she came on
Saturday and we are expressing surprise about it.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">We know how to interpret this in
English and it's easy to learn how to interpret "janai"in Japanese
once we understand the range of meaning it possesses.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Janai"gets used with other meanings
too.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Particularly, it gets used as a
negative question tag-ending very much like "ne".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">For example, we might say "atsui
janai" which means pretty much the same thing as "atsui
ne".</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span style=
"overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 624.00px; height: 350.67px;">

title=""></span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">It's something like a tag-question,
expecting our listener to agree with us.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And we can note here that there's no
ambiguity at all in this, because "atsui janai"is not the negative
of "atsui"-- that's "atsukunai".</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And it can also be put after
verbs.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">For example, "mou itta janai", which
means "I already said that, didn't I?"</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">We should also note that "janai"is
often reduced to just "jan"in very colloquial speech, and it's
often used in that way when it's affirming something or asking for
confirmation.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Now, it's clear that these
expressions are very colloquial and in fact so colloquial that when
we use them with a verb or an adjective they're not in fact
grammatical.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And the reason for this, as I've
already alluded to, is that, for example, "atsui janai"is not the
negative of "atsui" because that's "atsukunai".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Why can't we use "janai" with verbs
or adjectives? Well, that's because, as we learned right back in
the first lesson, "janai"is in fact "deは nai", which is the
negative of the copula.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So if we say "これは pen だ" we're
saying "this is a pen"; if we say "これは pen deは nai", we're saying
"this is not a pen", and you can't properly use "deは nai" with
anything but two nouns.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">I don't actually think that these
colloquial statements are fundamentally ungrammatical.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">It's just that being colloquial may
leave a few steps out of the process.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">There are in fact much more formal
ways of using "deは nai" as a positive statement, but these of
course tidy up the grammar.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So, for example, if we say "その
rironが machigatte いる no deは ない でしょう ka", we're saying "Might that
theory not be in error?"</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span style=
"overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 624.00px; height: 350.67px;">

title=""></span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And we see we have essentially the
same construction that we've been dealing with before: "その rironが
machigatte いる.. deは nai", but that "の" turns it into a grammatical
statement.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Why? Because "その rironが machigatte
いる" means literally "that theory exists in a state of
mistaking".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">That's a verbal clause complete in
itself.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span style=
"overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 624.00px; height: 350.67px;">

title=""></span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">However, when we add "の", that "の",
as we've seen in other lessons, plays the role of a pronoun like
"thing"or "one" which is being modified by "machigatte
いる".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So now we have "that theory exists
in a state of error one".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So we have two nouns and we now need
the copula to join them together.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So "その rironが machigatte いる no deは
nai" means "that theory existing-in-error-one is not".</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span style=
"overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 624.00px; height: 350.67px;">

title=""></span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">The "でしょう ka"doesn't add anything
grammatically to the statement.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">As we know, adjectives like "ない"
stand on their own.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">They don't require a "だ" , even
though they get a "です" as a mere decoration, a non-grammatical
decoration, in formal speech, so what "でしょう ka"is doing here is
it's simply a flag put at the end of the complete grammatical
statement: "その rironが machigatte いる no deは nai".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"でしょう ka" turns it explicitly into a
question and into a suggestion rather than a statement.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So we're saying "Might that theory
not be a mistaken one"? Now, this can mean what it seems to
say.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">It can mean that we're in some doubt
and we're actually asking whether that might not be the
case.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">But a lot of the time this is used
not just as an assertion but as a quite strong
assertion.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">We might use this to sum up our
argument when we have definitively disproved the theory in
question.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">An American writer or speaker might
sum up such an argument with "It is now clear to anyone with an
intelligence greater than that of a Roomba that this theory holds
about as much water as a topless thimble in the Sahara Desert."
however, that kind of definite assertion in Japanese is not
considered either polite or very persuasive.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">It sounds as if you're trying to
make up for a weak argument by a strong assertion.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So the equivalent Japanese speaker
may sum up the same completely persuasive argument with "です kara その
rironは machigatte いる no deは ない でしょう ka".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And that means exactly the same
thing, allowing for cultural differences.</span></p>

Lesson 39: The か Ka-particle's Secret Life! "Buried questions",
Kana, Monka, Ka dou ka & much more</a></span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">こんにちは.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Today we're going to talk about
questions that aren't questions.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">They come up all the time in
Japanese, so it's important to understand what they are and how
they work.</span></p>
<h2 class="c22" id="h.41koup3jmers"><span class="c16">The particle
か</span></h2>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So, what we're going to talk about
is the particle -ka.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Now, we probably know the particle
-ka as a kind of verbal question mark that goes at the end of です/ます
sentences to turn them into questions.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">However, we don't use -ka, as we
explained last week, at the end of sentences to mark them as
questions in regular, non-formal Japanese.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span style=
"overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 624.00px; height: 350.67px;">
<img alt="" src="images/image344.jpg" style=

title=""></span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Why not? Because putting -ka at the
end of a non-formal sentence sounds kind of blunt and rough. It's
not ungrammatical, and it's sometimes used by male speakers who
want to sound blunt or rough. But generally speaking, we don't use
it. We indicate questions by intonation in regular
speech.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">But we do use the -ka marker all the
time, just not at the end of sentences.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">What do we use it for? Well, we use
it to mark questions, but not quite what we normally think of when
we say "question".</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So let's start right off with an
example.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Suppose we say, "さくらが kuru-ka
wakaranai." what we're saying is "I don't know if Sakura will
come."</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span style=
"overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 624.00px; height: 350.67px;">
<img alt="" src="images/image369.jpg" style=
"width: 624.00px; height: 350.67px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);"
title=""></span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And what's literally happening here
is that we're turning the logical sentence, the proposition, "さくらが
kuru", which means "Sakura will come", into a question, and then
we're saying "wakaranai."</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So we're essentially saying "Sakura
come (question), not clear / The question of whether Sakura will
come is not clear to me."In English, "I don't know if Sakura's
coming."</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Now, we can use this as part of an
actual question. We might say "さくらが kuru-ka shitte
iます-ka."</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span style=
"overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 624.00px; height: 350.67px;">
<img alt="" src="images/image328.jpg" style=
"width: 624.00px; height: 350.67px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);"
title=""></span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Now, if we ask that in です/ます form,
as I just did, we use a second -ka at the end to mark the actual
question. So we're saying "the question of whether Sakura will
come, do you know?"</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And we should notice here that
what's happening is, first of all, the -ka is turning the
proposition, the question, into something noun-like which we can
then use as the basis of a new sentence.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span style=
"overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 624.00px; height: 350.67px;">
<img alt="" src="images/image148.jpg" style=
"width: 624.00px; height: 350.67px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);"
title=""></span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So that's the first thing we need to
notice, and the second thing we need to notice is that -ka
displaces logical particles most of the time.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So, normally when we say
"wakaranai", we say "(nani-nani)が wakaranai"; if we say "shitteru",
we say "(nani-nani) を shitteru"; but in this case the -ka particle
displaces the normal logical particle.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span style=
"overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 624.00px; height: 350.67px;">
<img alt="" src="images/image170.jpg" style=
"width: 624.00px; height: 351.00px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: -0.17px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);"
title=""></span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So we say "さくらが kuru-ka
wakaranai"not "さくらが kuru-kaが wakaranai."So "さくらが kuru-ka"is a
noun-like entity which, because it ends in -ka, doesn't need to
take the usual logical particle.</span></p>
<h2 class="c22" id="h.7saoech4lcdc"><span class=
"c16">かどうか</span></h2>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Now, it also gets used in the common
expression "ka dou ka".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And although we can learn this as a
glued と gether expression meaning "whether or not", so "さくらが
kuru-ka dou-ka wakaranai" means "I don't know whether Sakura's
coming or not".</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span style=
"overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 624.00px; height: 350.67px;">
<img alt="" src="images/image232.jpg" style=
"width: 624.00px; height: 350.67px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);"
title=""></span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">In English that's how we'd say it,
as opposed to "さくらが kuru-ka wakaranai"-- in English we'd say "I
don't know if Sakura's coming" ; "さくらが kuru-ka dou-ka wakaranai"--
we'd say in English "I don't know whether Sakura's coming or
not."</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">What we're literally saying here is
"Sakura coming (question) how (question) wakaranai."</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So what we're saying is something
like "I don't know if Sakura's coming or how it will
be."</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">か between nouns</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And from this we can see how we get
the use of -ka to mean "or" between nouns.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So we can say "ocha-ka コーヒー dochiraが
ii?" -- "tea or coffee, which would you like?"</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span style=
"overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 624.00px; height: 350.67px;">
<img alt="" src="images/image197.jpg" style=
"width: 624.00px; height: 350.67px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);"
title=""></span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Now, how is this working? Well,
essentially this is an abbreviation of "ocha-ka コーヒー-ka dochiraが
ii?"</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So, we're putting two propositions
side by side, "whether coffee or whether tea," and then asking
"dochiraが ii?" and once again although this seems like a different
use, -ka is doing the same thing -- it's bundling something up as a
proposition.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">But remember than when we use "or"in
English it's always got to be a question. It's never a certainty.
If we say "a or B" we're saying it might be A and it might be B. If
we say "a and B", we know what we're talking about. We know that
both A and B exist or do whatever it is that we're saying. But if
we say "a or B", we don't know whether it's A or whether it's B. We
know it's one of them.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So, again this -ka, this
questioning-whether particle, is continuing to use that function of
marking a possibility, a question, something that might happen or
might not happen, might be there or might not be there.</span></p>
<h2 class="c22" id="h.ponu9x6jpdxd"><span class=
"c16">かもしらない</span></h2>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Now, we see this at work, for
example, in "kamoshirenai".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Now, this is taught as if it were a
word or expression that means "maybe".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And it is, but teaching it as a lump
like that, as I've explained in another video, is
misleading.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">The point of that misleadingness
that I would like to talk about here is that it confuses us about
what that -ka is actually doing.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">That -ka is attached to the
proposition that we are talking about.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span style=
"overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 624.00px; height: 350.67px;">
<img alt="" src="images/image352.jpg" style=
"width: 624.00px; height: 350.67px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);"
title=""></span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So, if we say "さくらが
kuru-ka-mo-shireない" -- "Perhaps Sakura will come", what we're
saying is "さくらが kuru-ka", that's the question or proposition that
we're talking about, and then "-mo-shireない."</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">The も is giving us the meaning of
"even"or "as much as", as I've explained that it very often does,
and "shireない" is "shいる" -- "know"/ "shireru" -- "ability to know or
be known" and the helper adjective "ない".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So the whole thing actually means
"さくらが kuru-ka" -- "the question of whether Sakura comes" --
"mo-shireない" -- "I can't go so far as to know / Maybe Sakura will
come, maybe she won't."</span></p>
<h2 class="c22" id="h.d29uz3y53qw0"><span class=
"c16">かな</span></h2>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Similarly with "ka-na", which is
sometimes presented as a particle meaning "I wonder", you see how
this actually works.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span style=
"overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 624.00px; height: 350.67px;">
<img alt="" src="images/image167.jpg" style=
"width: 624.00px; height: 350.67px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);"
title=""></span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Ka"is taking the proposition, so if
we say "さくらが kuru-ka-na", we're saying "さくらが kuru-ka" -- "the
question of whether Sakura will come" -- "na".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Now, "na", as we've discussed in
another video, is a marker that indicates addressing something to
yourself.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So, you're saying "will Sakura
come?" addressing that to yourself.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">The way we would say that in English
is "I wonder if Sakura will come / I am pondering the question of
whether Sakura will come."</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And while it's all right to learn
things like "ka-na" and "ka-mo-shireない" as if they were what the
textbooks say they are, lumps of grammar that you just have to
memorize, it helps not only with those but with structure as a
whole to understand what they're really doing.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">They're bundling something into a
question, so a proposition becomes a question which is a noun-like
entity which we can then add something like "do you know / I don't
know / I can't be sure"or "I wonder (I'm addressing this question
to myself)."</span></p>
<h2 class="c22" id="h.a1zvl21n9ikg"><span class=
"c16">かのよう</span></h2>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Now, from this proposition-making
quality and questioning quality of -ka, we get expressions such as
one which we discussed in a previous video, "まるで 幽霊 を mita-ka の you
na kao."</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span style=
"overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 624.00px; height: 350.67px;">
<img alt="" src="images/image274.jpg" style=
"width: 624.00px; height: 350.67px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);"
title=""></span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Now, that means "a face as if one
had seen a ghost."So what's the -ka doing here? It's doing the same
thing as before.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">It's marking "幽霊 を mita" as a
question, a proposition, a thing that's not certain, in fact in
this particular case, a thing that hasn't happened: we're not
saying that the person HAS seen a ghost, we're only saying that she
had a face AS IF she had seen a ghost.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So we're marking the proposition
that she'd seen a ghost as a question and then continuing to
comment on it, and in this case we actually are attaching a logical
particle, the logical particle -no, to the ka-marked noun-like
entity that we have made of the proposition that she is seeing a
ghost.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So with a no-particle, unlike the
ga- and を particle, we can attach this to a ka-marked
entity.</span></p>
<h2 class="c22" id="h.aj0pf7mn2qfx"><span class=
"c16">もんか</span></h2>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Now, there is another use of -ka,
which is a little different but still closely related to its
question-making quality. And that is in certain expressions where
it negativizes what we're talking about.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">An example of this that you've
probably come across if you've been watching anime or reading manga
is "mon-ka".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And that's short for "mono-ka", and
it can be used in more formal speech, in which case we say "mono
です-ka".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So, if I were to say "sochira-he iku
mono です-ka,"I'm saying "I won't go there / I'm not going
there."</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">If I say "さくらが kuru mono です-ka,"I'm
saying "Sakura is not coming / She won't come / There's no
likelihood of her coming."</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">What does "mono です-ka"mean? It means
literally "Is that a thing?"So, it's a question, but it's the kind
of negativizing question that we also get in English when we say
things like "Do you think I'm going to do that?"or "would I do
that?"or " how likely is that?"In all those cases, by turning
something into a question we're denying its likelihood.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Now, when we say "mono-ka"it's the
same thing, and it often gets reduced right down to
"mon-ka".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So someone might say "Sore を 食べる
mon-ka" -- "I'm not eating that." and you notice here that we are
in fact using the -ka marker after a regular non-formal sentence,
and that's because "mon-ka"or "mono-ka"is in fact rather a rough
way of talking. You're denying something very forcefully and often
in opposition to somebody.</span></p>
<h2 class="c22" id="h.32mevxx0qt74"><span class=
"c16">どころか</span></h2>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Another place where we often see -ka
as a negativizing question marker is in "dokoro-ka".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Now, "dokoro"is a form of "ところ",
which we talked about in a recent lesson, didn't we? "ところ"can mean
not just "place"in the literal sense, but a time or a circumstance
or condition.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">When it's said as "dokoro"it's
usually negative, so when we say "dokoro-ka", we're negativizing
what came before it and usually putting an even stronger negative
after it.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So if we say, for example, "kanjiが
読める dokoro-ka hiragana-mo yomenai" -- "Not only can't I read kanji,
I can't even read hiragana."</span></p>

<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">What's "dokoro-ka"doing here? Well,
of course it's negativizing, just as we've already seen that it
can, but it's also using the concept of place / "ところ", that's to
say, conceptual space rather than literal place.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">We're saying "Not only can't I go as
far as reading kanji, I can't even get to the point of reading
hiragana." that's the metaphor that's being used here: not only has
the situation not reached this far place, it hasn't even reached a
nearer place than that.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span>So we see that while -ka has a variety of
meanings, all of them are closely connected to its ability to make
a question and turn the question into a proposition, but never a
proposition that exists in actuality, always a hypothetical
condition.</span></p>

3 PITFALLS in Japanese and how to avoid them 【Japanese Structure
Lesson 40】</a></span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">こんにちは.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Today we're going to discuss some
pitfalls in Japanese structure.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">These are very small elements,
single kana elements of the language, but very vital ones that can,
if you don't know about them, be very confusing because one element
can be easily confused with another one that looks
identical.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And the textbooks, in many cases,
don't tell you about this at all.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">They leave you completely
floundering.</span></p>
<h2 class="c22" id="h.45ckc7ke1s58"><span class="c16">で: particle /
で: て-form of だ</span></h2>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">The first one we're going to look at
is "で".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Now, "で", as you know, is a logical
particle. It has a very clearly defined use which we introduced in
Lesson 8b. Like all logical particles, it marks a noun, and it
tells us that that noun is the place where an action took place or
the means by which an action was done.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">However, there is another "で", which
is not a particle, which is also used very frequently in Japanese,
and the textbooks make no attempt to distinguish these two
completely different but identical-looking elements.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">The first time most of us will meet
the second of these "で"s is in the use of adjectival nouns, which
are very confusingly and misleadingly called "な-adjectives" by the
textbooks.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So if we say "さくらがきれいで優し", what
we're saying is that Sakura is pretty and kind.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span style=
"overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 624.00px; height: 350.67px;">

title=""></span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"きれいだ" is an adjectival
noun.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">If we want to say "the flower is
pretty", we say " 花がきれいだ".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And if we want to say "the pretty
flower", we have to put "きれいだ" on the other side of the flower, so
we say "きれいな花".</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span style=
"overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 624.00px; height: 350.67px;">
<img alt="" src="images/image257.jpg" style=

title=""></span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And that "な", as we know, is the
connective form of "だ".</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">But if we want to say "Sakura is
pretty and kind", we can't use "だ" and we can't use "na", but we do
have to use the copula.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span style=
"overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 624.00px; height: 350.67px;">
<img alt="" src="images/image265.jpg" style=
"width: 624.00px; height: 350.67px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);"
title=""></span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">What we use now is the connective
form of the copula, that is to say, its て-form. And the て-form of
"だ" is "で".</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So if you say "Sakura is beautiful
and kind", this is a true adjective, an "い-Adjective", and we use
the て-form to connect it: we say "さくらが utsukushikute や
sashii."</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">If it's an adjectival noun, we still
have to have the copula, so we say "さくらが きれい de..." that's the
て-form of the copula.</span></p>
<h3 class="c11" id="h.dgjzmfxr3k75"><span class=
"c29">てください</span></h3>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Now, I've already explained that in
our lessons on adjectivals, but we also find this "で", the て-form
of "だ" , in lots of other cases in Japanese. So let's take a couple
of cases and see if you can tell which of the two "で"s is being
used.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">A very common thing to say to
someone when you're leaving them, perhaps for a while, is "o genki
de". Now, "genki", as you know, means "well"or " healthy"or
"lively" and the "お" is just an honorific or prettifier.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">What is the "で" here? Is it the
logical particle or is it the て-form of the copula?</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span style=
"overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 624.00px; height: 350.67px;">
<img alt="" src="images/image224.jpg" style=
"width: 624.00px; height: 351.00px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: -0.17px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);"
title=""></span></p>
<p class="c19 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">This is the て-form of the copula,
not the particle.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">The particle doesn't make any sense
here, does it? What's the て-form of the copula doing?</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Well, we know, don't we, that the
て-form is often used to make an imperative, to tell someone or ask
someone to do something. So, if we say "matte" -- "wait"-- this is
kind of short for "matte ください" and we're asking someone to wait
("matte!" -- "wait!").</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Now, it's exactly the same with "で",
which is the て-form of the copula. So, "元気 だ" means "is genki",
someone is genki, someone is healthy or lively. "Genki de"is
telling them to *be* genki or lively. "O genki de" -- "be healthy /
be lively / keep up the good spirits".</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Right. So here's another one: "buji
de よかった"is another very common expression and it means "I'm glad
that you're all right / it's good that you weren't harmed / it's
good that you're safe" -- "buji de よかった".</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span style=
"overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 624.00px; height: 350.67px;">
<img alt="" src="images/image21.jpg" style=
"width: 624.00px; height: 350.67px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);"
title=""></span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">What do we have here? Once again, we
have the て-form of the copula.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">" buji", which means literally "no
incident" and therefore it means "nothing happened / nothing bad
happened / you weren't harmed / you're safe."So, "buji だ" means
"you're safe / you weren't harmed / nothing happened".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">" buji de"is turning that "だ" , that
copula, into the connective form. We use the て-form to connect
things, don't we? So, just as we might say, "osoku natte sumiません"
-- "that I came late, I'm sorry"-- we also say "buji de よかった" --
"that you weren't hurt, that was good."</span></p>
<h3 class="c11" id="h.z442ihex17xu"><span class="c29">Connecting
sentences</span></h3>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And this connective て-form is also
used in longer compound sentences.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So, for example, we might say
"Sakuraは iiko de mainichi gakkouに 行く" -- "Sakura is a good child
and she goes to school every day."</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span style=
"overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 624.00px; height: 350.67px;">
<img alt="" src="images/image37.jpg" style=
"width: 624.00px; height: 350.67px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);"
title=""></span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">We have two complete clauses and,
just as with the て-form of any verb, we can use it to connect that
verb-ending clause to a second clause, so we can do exactly the
same thing with the copula.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So, "さくらが iiko だ" -- "Sakura's a
good girl"-- is a complete sentence in itself.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">If we want to connect it to a second
clause to make it the first half of a compound sentence, we turn
that "だ" into its て-form, "で". So, "Sakura is a good girl and she
goes to school every day."</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And as is usual with the て-form
connector, it tends to imply a positive relation between the two.
It has this implication of "because Sakura's a good girl, she goes
to school every day," but it's not stating it as strongly as if
we'd used から.</span></p>
<h2 class="c22" id="h.ashzqe3tm616"><span>が - But,
however</span></h2>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Now, another confusion, which is not
kept such a deep, dark secret by the textbooks, but they don't
always stress it clearly enough, and it's very important because it
concerns the very center of the Japanese language, and that is the
が particle.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">The が particle, as we know, is the
one particle that no sentence or clause in Japanese can ever be
without, whether we can see it or whether we can't.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Ga"marks the A-car of every
sentence, the do-er of an A-does-B clause and the be-er of an
A-is-B clause.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">But there is also another "ga". It's
not easy to confuse the two, provided you're clearly aware of
them.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">The other "ga"is also a clause
connector. And usually it's a contrastive clause
connector.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So, if we say, "お店に ittaが panが
なかった," we're saying "I went to the shops, but there wasn't any
bread."So, this is a contrastive conjunction.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span style=
"overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 624.00px; height: 350.67px;">
<img alt="" src="images/image332.jpg" style=
"width: 624.00px; height: 350.67px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);"
title=""></span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">We went to the shops hoping that
there would be bread, but there wasn't any.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">It's not possible to confuse this
with the other "ga", the "ga" that marks the subject of the
sentence, the A-car, because that "ga", the particle "ga", can only
ever mark a noun.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And the clause-connector "ga"can
only ever mark a complete sentence.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">The particle "ga"can't mark a
complete sentence, because a complete sentence can't end with a
noun. It has to end with a verb, an adjective, or a copula, as we
learned in our very first lesson.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So it's not possible to confuse
these two so long as you're clearly aware of them.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">One more thing that we should note
is that "ga"doesn't have to be contrastive.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Most of the time it is, but it can
be used as a regular, non-contrastive conjunction.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">It's worth knowing that, because if
you see it connecting two clauses and there doesn't seem to be any
contrast there, you don't have to rack your brains to find the
contrast -- occasionally it is used in a non-contrastive
manner.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And the other thing you need to know
is that you will sometimes find this contrastive "ga" at the end of
a sentence.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And I have talked before about
sentences that end in a conjunction.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Strictly, they're not complete,
because what they're doing is implying a following
clause.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Ga" at the end of a sentence is
often a politeness, because "ga"is in fact more polite than
"kedo"or "でも" , the other ways of saying "but".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So if we said something like "コーヒーが
ほしい ga" -- "coffee is want-making (to me)" and then we've added
"ga".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And what that "ga"is doing is saying
"but..." and it's implying a second clause but not stating it, so
"コーヒーが ほしい ga" means something like "I would like coffee, but… if
it's any trouble please don't try to get me any coffee"or something
along those lines.</span></p>
<h2 class="c22" id="h.9lqf576vvm2z"><span class="c16">に - Listing
things</span></h2>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">The last one we're going to consider
is less common, but if you're reading any amount of Japanese you're
going to come across it pretty soon, and that is "に".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Now, we know "に". It's again a
logical particle. It's the targeting particle, and I've done a
whole video on this because it's an important and complex
particle.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">But there is also another "に". And
this other "に" , which is a slightly old usage -- it comes from
older Japanese -- it means the same as "to".</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span style=
"overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 624.00px; height: 350.67px;">

title=""></span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">It can be used to and と gether two
nouns or a list of nouns.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So in the folk tale Beauty and the
Beast, when the father asks one of the less good sisters what she
would like him to bring back for her, she says "kutsu ni yubiwa ni
boushi".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">She's saying she would like shoes
and a ring and a hat.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So this "に" can be used to and と
gether two things or a list of things, and it's completely
different from the particle "に".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">It's a little bit literary, so
you're more often going to see it in written Japanese.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">But if you don't know that it's
there, you can spend a long time puzzling over what "に" means in
these contexts.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">It's also more commonly used in the
expression "sore ni", which means "furthermore"or "in addition to
that".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And, as you can see, this is made up
of "sore", which means "that", plus "に" -- not the particle "に" but
the "に" that means "and".</span></p>

5 key facts they never tell you about the basic structure of
Japanese. Lesson 41</a></span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">こんにちは.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Today we're going to talk about
something very important that affects the whole structure of
Japanese. And, surprise, surprise, the textbooks never explain this
properly.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">What we're going to talk about is
Japanese words. Not vocabulary, but the actual nature of the words
themselves and how they structurally work inside the
language.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">This isn't difficult. In fact, it's
very simple. But if you don't know it, it's very confusing because
you actually see a sentence and you don't know what the words are
really doing inside that sentence.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And this is the position that the
textbooks leave you in.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Now, the fact is that Japanese is
much simpler than English and much simpler than most languages in
the types of words that it has. However, the English textbooks and
dictionaries try to assimilate Japanese words to the various
English types and this doesn't work well at all and leads to
endless confusion.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So I'm going to present five facts
that will clarify the whole situation.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<h2 class="c22" id="h.c1yjwtn55yz7"><span class="c16">Fact 1:
Nearly all Japanese words fall into one of three
categories.</span></h2>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Just three.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And those three categories are:
Nouns, Verbs, and Adjectives.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span style=
"overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 624.00px; height: 350.67px;">

title=""></span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Now, there are also, as we know,
particles – they're not words, but they are the nuts and bolts that
hold the language together.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And there are a few -- a very few --
specialized words that don't fall into those three
categories.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">For example, there are conjunction
words that join together two logical clauses to make a compound
sentence.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Most conjunctions aren't done with
words anyway -- they're done with the て-form, the い-stem, or groups
of particles like "でも" and "noni".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">But there are a few dedicated
conjunctions like "kedo" and the other "ga", the "ga" that isn't a
particle but a conjunction, which we discussed in a recent
video.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Now, apart from these, everything
you see is going to be a noun, a verb, or an adjective.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<h2 class="c22" id="h.jaur0ohnlgyb"><span class="c16">Fact 2: Verbs
and adjectives are very easily recognized and
distinguished.</span></h2>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Every verb ends in an う row kana --
and it has to be a kana, it can't be included in kanji. And every
adjective has to end in the kana i.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Again, it has to be the kana, can't
be part of a kanji.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Now, as we know, there are certain
completely regular transformations that this う row kana and that
this i can make.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">They can go into て-form or た-form,
and the final う row kana of a verb can change into the equivalent
kana in the same row in order to attach a helper word such as the
negative helper adjective "ない" or the causative helper verb
"せる/させる".</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>

title=""></span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Now, once you know the basic
permutations of verbs and adjectives, which you should do very
early on, you know that if a word doesn't have one of those
possible verb endings or one of those possible adjective endings,
it is a noun.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">You know that if a word is written
in kanji only or can be written in kanji only, it is in 99 cases
out of 100 a noun.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So Japanese, as I've said before, is
a very noun-centered language.</span></p>
<h2 class="c22" id="h.pi473qisj5bj"><span class="c16">Fact 3: There
is a legion of super-nouns.</span></h2>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">What I mean by this is that there
are certain special categories of nouns, each of which has one
superpower and one only.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">That's to say that the nouns in each
of these groups of special or super-nouns differ from ordinary
nouns in one respect only. Now, two of those groups we already
know, so as Fact 4 I'm just going to go over those
quickly.</span></p>
<h2 class="c22" id="h.7kzl9me7naub"><span class="c16">Fact 4:
Adjectival Nouns and する nouns review</span></h2>
<h3 class="c11" id="h.tede53q9uu3c"><span class="c29">Adjectival
Nouns</span></h3>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">The first group is adjectival nouns,
which are horribly misnamed by the textbooks "na adjectives".
They're not adjectives. They are nouns that can under certain
circumstances be used adjectivally.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">The superpower of adjectival nouns,
the one thing they can do that makes them different from any other
noun, is that they can use the soft or connective form of the
copula "だ".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So, we can say " や shikiが fushigi だ"
-- "mansion mysterious is".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">When we do this we're just doing
what we can do with any noun.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">We can say "さくらが 日本人 だ" -- "Sakura
Japanese person is".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">But we can also use that soft form
of "だ" , which is "na", and we can say "fushigi-na や shiki" -
"mysterious-is mansion".</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span style=
"overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 624.00px; height: 350.67px;">

title=""></span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">You can't do that with a regular
noun.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And that's the only difference
between a regular noun and an adjectival noun.</span></p>
<h3 class="c11" id="h.lrrsd8b5gqw4"><span class="c29">する
Nouns</span></h3>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">The second group is する nouns, which
the dictionaries somewhat confusingly call "する verbs".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">What they are is nouns.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And their superpower is that they
are allowed to drop the direct object marker, "を".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So, if we take the noun "勉強", which
means "study", we can say "勉強 を する", which means "do study" but we
can also say "勉強 する", which means "study" (the verb).</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So when we do that, we fuse together
"勉強" with "する" and make what we really can call a "する
verb".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span style=
"overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 624.00px; height: 350.67px;">
<img alt="" src="images/image174.jpg" style=

title=""></span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">We can use the を to mark a direct
object of any verb, but we can only drop that を in the case of する
nouns.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">That is their superpower.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">But the important point to remember
is that when "する" is not attached to it, it's not a する
verb.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">It's not any kind of a
verb.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">It's a noun.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So we can say "勉強が 好き だ".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">That means "study is pleasing to
me".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">We don't say "勉強すru-noが 好き だ" ,
because what we'd be doing if we said that would be taking a noun,
turning it into a verb with "する", and then turning it back into a
noun again with "の".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">We don't need to do that because
it's a noun in the first place.</span></p>
<h2 class="c22" id="h.yb35pztumxqz"><span class="c16">Fact 5:
Adverbial nouns, the third noun group</span></h2>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Now, the third group, which we
haven't yet introduced, is adverbial nouns.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Now, there are a lot of these and an
awful lot of them end in the kana "ri", but not all of them by any
means.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So, we're going to look at two that
do and one that doesn't, and we're going to look at their
superpower.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Their superpower is very similar to
the superpower of the する noun, which is to say that they can drop
the relevant particle under certain circumstances.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">As we know, any noun that's
appropriate for the use can be turned into an adverb by adding
に.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So, "静か", which is the noun "quiet",
can be used adverbially with に.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">We can say "静かに する" -- "do quietly /
act quietly".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">We can say "静かに 歩く" -- "walk
quietly".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">With adverbial nouns, we can drop
that に.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So, we'll take one that ends in the
typical "ri": "ゆっくり"-- that means ''slow'' or ''leisurely'' -- and
we can say "ゆっくりに する" -- "act in a leisurely manner", "ゆっくりに 歩く" --
"walk slowly".</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span style=
"overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 624.00px; height: 350.67px;">

title=""></span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">But we can also say "ゆっくり する", "ゆっくり
歩く".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">We can drop that に.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So, that's the one and only
superpower of the adverbial noun.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And it's important to understand
this because when you start trying to explain them without
recognizing this fundamental fact, you can get into all kinds of
difficulty.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Let's take another one:
"amari".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Now, this noun is usually explained
in a way that's completely confusing.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">" amari"is a noun, and what it means
is "excess".</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span style=
"overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 624.00px; height: 350.67px;">
<img alt="" src="images/image155.jpg" style=

title=""></span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">You can use it in a completely
literal sense.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">You can say "gohan の amari"-- which
means "the excess rice / the leftover cooked rice".</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">It's very often used in more
abstract ways.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So, we can say "kanashimi no amari
naita".</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span style=
"overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 624.00px; height: 350.67px;">
<img alt="" src="images/image88.jpg" style=
"width: 624.00px; height: 350.67px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);"
title=""></span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Now, this means "from an excess of
sadness, I cried." and, as you see, we can leave out the
particle.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">We usually do leave out the particle
with "amari".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So it's now being used adverbially
and it still means "excess".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Now, the textbooks generally
introduce it in a different context, which makes it very confusing
when we see it in other contexts and especially when we don't
understand that it's actually a noun.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">They show it being used adverbially
in expressions like "amari 勉強 shinai".</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span style=
"overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 624.00px; height: 350.67px;">
<img alt="" src="images/image200.jpg" style=
"width: 624.00px; height: 350.67px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);"
title=""></span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">What does that literally mean? It
literally means "I don't study too much / I don't do an excess of
study." but of course, as we know, what it means in practice is
that "I don't study very much".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And this is what we call litotes.
We've talked about hyperbole in language and how it's a very common
phenomenon. Litotes is the opposite of hyperbole.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Hyperbole is saying more than we
really mean; litotes is saying less than we really mean.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">The word "litotes"isn't as well
known as " hyperbole". That's perhaps because current Western
speech is much more prone to hyperbole than to litotes. But we
still have litotes in set expressions.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So, if we are going on a picnic and
we look at the dark clouds in the sky and say "It doesn't look too
good!" what we're literally saying is "It doesn't look excessively
good" but what we actually mean is "It doesn't look very good!" and
it's just the same with "amari".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">If we say "amari 勉強 shinai", we're
saying "I don't study too much / I don't study excessively" but
what we actually mean is "I don't study very much at
all."</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So, let's just take one more that
doesn't end in "ri", and that's "zuibun".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">What it really means is
"sufficiently".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And you may say, "well,
'sufficiently' isn't a noun". And that's true -- in English it
isn't a noun. In Japanese it is.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span style=
"overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 624.00px; height: 350.67px;">
<img alt="" src="images/image25.jpg" style=
"width: 624.00px; height: 350.67px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);"
title=""></span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And if we look at the kanji
"zuibun", what it actually means is something like "appropriate
portion"or "appropriate amount"-- in other words, "sufficient"or
"sufficiently".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And this is another litotes which is
common to both English and Japanese and many other
languages.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">When you say to someone "zuibun
jouzu だ ne", what you're literally saying is "you're skilful enough
/ you're sufficiently skilful". What you actually mean is that the
person is very skilful.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And this is just the same in
English. You might say "You're pretty good".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And "zuibun", like "pretty"or
"fairly"in English can run the full range from its original meaning
of "sufficiently"or "fairly" to its more usual litotes meaning of
"very /considerably".</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So the thing to remember is that
there are a very limited number of word-types in
Japanese.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Nearly all words are either verbs,
nouns or adjectives.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And the ones that aren't verbs or
adjectives, whatever the dictionaries tell you they are, are
practically all the time nouns.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span>When you understand that, you have a much
clearer understanding of what's going on in a sentence.</span></p>

Why textbook "grammar points" are so misleading. Basic
word-confusion | まま mama | Lesson 42</a></span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">こんにちは.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Today we're going to talk about some
of the ways in which the standard conventional explanations of
Japanese lead you out into the desert and then fly away in a
helicopter, laughing.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">We talked in the earlier lessons in
this series about how that happens in relation to the fundamental
structure of the language.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">But this also happens at a later
stage with the explanation of all kinds of what they call "grammar
points". And one of the main causes of this is the fact that they
fail to recognize what words actually are and what they actually
do.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So, we're going to take, as an
example, "mama", the word "mama".</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Now, this can mean a mother or the
mistress of a bar or a cafe, but we're talking about in in the
other sense, the more abstract sense, which, if we look at
traditional explanations, they seem to have various opinions on
what part of speech it is. I've even seen it described as a
particle, which it certainly isn't.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And they tell you that it means "as
it is / as we wish it to be / as we would like it to be", that it
means a state or a condition.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Now, all those thing are things that
we might say in English in relation to certain uses of the word.
But none of them express what the word actually means.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">In any case, if it meant "as it
is"or "as we wish it to be", what kind of a word would it
be?</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So the first thing to ask ourselves
is "what kind of a word is it?" and, as I explained in our last
lesson, nearly all Japanese words fall into one of three
categories: nouns, verbs, and adjectives.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Now, "mama"is not a verb: it doesn't
end in う or any う-row kana.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">It's not an adjective: doesn't end
in -i.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So the chances are it's a noun, and
that's exactly what it is.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">It's a noun.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So, what kind of a noun is it? What
does it mean? What is a "mama"? A "mama"is a thing; it's a
noun.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">What kind of a thing is it? Well,
it's a very simple thing, a very straightforward thing, and once we
know what it is we can understand it in all
circumstances.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">A "mama"is an unchanged
condition.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span style=

<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Wherever you see "mama", you can
read "unchanged condition".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">There's one circumstance in which it
has a slightly extended meaning and apart from that -- which is
very simple and we'll come to that shortly -- we have the
definition, the understanding of "mama": "unchanged
condition".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So, let's look at some of the ways
in which it's used.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">We can say "shizen no mama no
mori"-- that's "a forest in its natural state".</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span style=
"overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 624.00px; height: 350.67px;">

title=""></span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Shizen"is nature" and "mama"is
"unchanged state"or "unchanged condition".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So, "shizen no mama"is the
"unchanged condition of nature".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Shizen no mama no mori"is "the
forest in the unchanged condition of nature".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Now, when you're in Japan somebody
may offer you edamame, which are beans which grow from the branches
of trees, which is why they're called edmame (which means "branch
bean").</span></p>

<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And you might look at them, they're
not cooked or anything, you might say "その mama de 食べられる no?" --
"Can you eat them just as they are / can you eat them in their
unchanged condition?"</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Now, that "で"is in fact the copula,
so we're saying "being their unchanged condition, can we eat
them?"</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Now, there's one thing we can do
with "mama" that we can't do with all nouns and that is that we can
drop that "で".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So we can say "その mama 食べられる?"Now,
we can say that this is because "mama"is something like an
adverbial noun that we discussed last week, where you are allowed
to drop the particle in certain cases, but I don't think we
necessarily even have to go that far.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">" an unchanged condition"is by
definition a condition that could change but hasn't
changed.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So, I think in cases like this if we
say "その mama de 食べられる", we're saying "その mama 食べられる" without the
"で", I would say, is treating that "その mama"like a relative time
expression.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">We're saying "while they're in their
unchanged condition", so we're essentially talking about a time
period, the time period during which they are in their unchanged
condition.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So this is actually how I would tend
to look at it.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"During the period when they're in
their unchanged condition, can we eat them?"</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">In any case, there's no doubt what
the word means. It means "unchanged condition".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">We can say "pajama no mama asagohan
を 食べる".</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span style=

<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">That means "Eat breakfast while
we're still in our pajamas".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">In other words, "in the unchanged
condition of being still in our pajamas, eat breakfast".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And as we can see, once again the
implication here is that the condition could change but hasn't
changed.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Itsumademo w赤い mama de itai" --
"I'd like to stay young forever.""I'd like to stay in the unchanged
condition of being young forever."</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span style=
"overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 624.00px; height: 350.67px;">

title=""></span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And notice here that we're saying
"w赤い mama", so you see "w赤い" , the adjective, is doing what
adjectives always do, qualifying a noun.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And the noun it's qualifying is
"mama": "the unchanged condition of being young".</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Now, there's a use of "mama" that
you'll probably come across quite often, and that is "omoi no
mama"or "kokoro no mama".</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span style=
"overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 624.00px; height: 350.67px;">

title=""></span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And what this means is "in the
unchanged condition that's in our thoughts"or "...in our
hearts".</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So what does this actually mean?
Well, it's always applied to something that is outside ourselves,
so we're talking about something outside ourselves being in the
unchanged condition, the exact same condition, as what is inside
ourselves.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So this essentially means making the
outside world conform to our thoughts, our desires, our
will.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And this can under certain
circumstances imply selfishness, but it doesn't need to.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">I think the first time I heard it
was in an anime where the characters were underwater. They were
able to breathe but they found that they couldn't move the way that
they wanted to, just as one can't in water.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And they said "omoi no mama ni
ugokenai" -- "we are unable to move in the unchanged condition of
our thoughts"or "...the unchanged condition of our will or
desire".</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span style=
"overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 624.00px; height: 350.67px;">

title=""></span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Now, we should understand here that
"omoi"sometimes does imply desire.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">For example, when we say "kata
omoi", which is literally "one-sided thought"or "one-side thought",
what that actually means is "unrequited love".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">It means having a desire for someone
but it's only one side of the desire. The other person doesn't
reciprocate that desire. So it's "kata omoi" -- "one-sided
thought"or "one-sided desire".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So "omoi no mama"is "in the
unchanged condition of one's thought or desire".</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And it's really from this use of
"mama" that we get "wagamama", which I'm sure you've heard, which
means "selfish"or "selfishness".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Why does it mean that? Well, "waga"
means "I"or "we" and it can be put next to a noun to denote
possession of it.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So we can say "waga や ", which means
"my house"or "our house".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">" wagamama" means "my unchanged
condition", but this clearly is influenced by expressions like
"omoi no mama"or "kokoro no mama".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So this "wagamama" means "my
unchanged condition"implying "my will", "wanting the world to go in
accordance with my will," wanting the world to be "omoi no mama",
"kokoro no mama".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So as we see the whole of "mama", we
don't have to have all these different definitions of
it.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">We can see that every time we use it
it means the same thing.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span>It means "unchanged condition".</span></p>

Japanese learning PARADIGM SHIFT: Cut through the confusion. Lesson
43</a></span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">こんにちは.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Today we're going to talk about what
I rather over-dramatically refer to as "the Final
Problem".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">What I mean by that is that we're
going to unlock a new area of Japanese and we're going to do it by
the same method that we started with, that is, by looking at
Japanese as Japanese and not as English written in some secret
code.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">The reason I call it "the final
problem"is because this is the one problem that some of my most
astute and analytical pupils find with my Japanese-structure
models.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">For the most part, if somebody
understands my models, they become self-evident.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And that's what I base my work on. I
don't ask anyone to trust me. See if they work. If they don't work,
throw them away. If they do work, use them. There's no act of faith
involved anywhere.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Now, I take this one problem as a
tribute to my work.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Partly because, of course, there
only is one problem, which out of a whole and very radical model of
Japanese is pretty interesting.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">But the second reason is this:
people have this problem because I've spoiled them.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">I say that somewhat humorously, but
the truth is that people come out of this world of English
"Japanese grammar explanations"in Genki and the various Japanese
grammar (so-called) websites and they're leaving a world of an
entangled mass of strange things that just happen to mean what they
mean for no particular reason and with a whole range of exceptions
and random rules into a world of crystalline logic where everything
makes sense, where everything is what it is for a good
reason.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And so when they come across
something that looks like an exception or a random rule, they want
to get rid of it.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">They won't tolerate even one of
these things any more and I can't blame them.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">However, this is not a random
rule.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">This is something that's very
understandable if we can make the same kind of paradigm shift that
we made in the first place and see it as it really is in Japanese,
not look at it through English eyes.</span></p>
<h2 class="c22" id="h.rgkb4kwycesc"><span class=
"c16">好き</span></h2>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So what is this? Let's take an
example.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">If we say "クレープが 好き だ" , we've
learned that this does not mean "I like crepes".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">If you think it means "I like
crepes", then you've really given up all hope of ever understanding
Japanese structure.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Because, as we know, every Japanese
sentence has two core elements.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">It can have any one of three
engines, which can be a verb, an adjective, or a noun plus
copula.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And the second part of the core
sentence is always the same: it's a noun marked with が.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">We can't always see it, but it's
always there.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span style=
"overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 624.00px; height: 350.67px;">
<img alt="" src="images/image121.jpg" style=

title=""></span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And those two elements, the engine
and the が marked subject (or main carriage), are the core of any
sentence. They're the only things we need in a sentence.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">We've got to have those two, and
everything else in a logical clause is telling us more about either
the engine or the が marked carriage.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">It can't do anything
else.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">The core of the sentence is the
sentence and everything else is an appendage to one of those two
core elements.</span></p>
<h2 class="c22" id="h.fc1wcs1nm72e"><span class=
"c16">たい</span></h2>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So, with "クレープが 食べたい" , the が marked
carriage is not "I", so it can't be "I want to eat
crepes".</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span style=
"overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 624.00px; height: 350.67px;">
<img alt="" src="images/image117.jpg" style=

title=""></span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Because "I" am not doing something
here, the crepes are the が marked main carriage.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And the head of the sentence, the
engine, is not a verb, it's an adjective.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">It's the helper adjective
"たい".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">It's attached to a verb, but the
actual engine of the sentence isn't a verb, it's the adjective
"たい".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">It can't mean "want", because
"want"is a verb.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So what this is actually saying is
that the quality of crepes is such that it induces want in
me.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">This is a wordy way of putting it,
but it avoids any kind of English-based misreading of the
sentence.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">That's what it actually
means.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">It's describing the crepes
adjectivally, and what it's saying about them is that they have the
quality of making me want to eat them.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And what we learned right from the
beginning is that English is a very ego-centric
language.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">If there is an action, a
subjectivity, it always wants to put an ego-actor at the
center.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span style=
"overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 624.00px; height: 350.67px;">

title=""></span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Japanese doesn't have that strong
imperative.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Now, if we look at it in terms of
subjectivities -- because a lot of this is to do with subjective
feelings, as a lot of language is -- we can look at subjectivities
in two ways.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">We can either look at them with the
thing that induces the subjectivity as the focus, the fulcrum, of
the subjectivity, so "crepes which induce desire in me" are the
fulcrum of this sentence.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Crepes are inducing eatで sire in
me."Or we can look at the subjectivity as an activity -- wanting --
and then we put "me" at the center.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">We put the ego at the center and we
say "I desire to eat crepes".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Now, both of these are fairly
natural.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">A subjectivity is in fact something
that we passively experience and that is induced in us by something
on the outside of us.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">That is a perfectly valid way of
looking at things, and perhaps more valid than the English
ego-centric way. Certainly no less valid.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Japanese happens to prefer this way
of looking at it; English prefers the other.</span></p>
<h2 class="c22" id="h.elqkgjol8pxx"><span class="c16">られる -
Passive</span></h2>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And this spills over into all kinds
of areas.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So, for example, Japanese is very
happy to say "mizuが inuに nomareta" which means "the water
drink-received from the dog".</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span style=
"overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 624.00px; height: 350.67px;">

title=""></span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">The key actor of this sentence is
the water, not the dog.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">The water is receiving the act of
drinking from the dog.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">English is so biased against this
that it's almost impossible to translate this into English without
turning it passive. It's not passive in Japanese.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And this bias goes so deep that the
entire "-れる/られる" helper verb, which is the verb of receiving an
action, is called "the passive" by this pseudo-Japanese grammar
that gets taught in English.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">It's not passive -- it's just that
the only way to translate it into English is to turn it
passive.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Now, let's get back to our
crepes.</span></p>
<h2 class="c22" id="h.jfn0s5badtzj"><span class="c16">Zero
pronoun</span></h2>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">If we say "クレープが 食べたい" , the center
of the action is the crepes.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">They are inducing desire in
me.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">If we say "onakaが suita, 早く 食べたい" ,
we're saying "I'm hungry; I want to eat soon."Now, "早く 食べたい"
doesn't have a visible actor, but the actor of this - the zero - is
"me", so it's "(zeroが) 早く 食べたい" -- "I want to eat soon."Now, this
is the final problem.</span></p>

title=""></span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">This is the thing that some of my
most astute students have reacted against.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">They don't like the fact that the
"たい" helper adjective switches polarity, that it can both describe
something inducing the desire to eat and the person feeling the
desire to eat if the inducer is not explicitly present.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">They actually have suggested -- and
several people have suggested this to me independently -- have
suggested the work-around of saying "well, can't we say that the が
marked actor is in fact food? Just food in general perhaps: 'Food
is making me want to eat it.'" and I see why they're trying to do
this.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">They're trying to get rid of what
looks like the one anomaly in an otherwise perfectly logical
system.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">But actually this isn't an anomaly,
and we'll come to that in a moment.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">The work-around doesn't work,
firstly because if you know much about Japanese you understand that
this is not what's happening.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Someone is not saying they're
wanting to eat anything or food in general, they're just saying
that they want to eat.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">That's something I think you'll
intuitively come to understand, but I also understand that
intuition is not an argument.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Even Genki could probably use the
intuition card to support some of their rather outlandish
interpretations of Japanese.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">But we don't have to rely on that.
We can produce proof.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Let's take the sentence "toukように
ikitai." this means "I want to go to Tokyo."Now, there is no
possible other "zeroが"in this sentence than "I".</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span style=

<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">It can't be Tokyo, because that's
already the ni-marked destination.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">It can't be "go" because that's a
verb and we can never mark anything but a noun withが or any other
logical particle.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So we know for certain that it is in
fact possible for "たい" to flip its polarity, to point not to the
object inducing desire to do but also to the person or animal
experiencing the desire to do.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And this goes on to extend to other
areas of Japanese.</span></p>
<h2 class="c22" id="h.7wemhc3v92ly"><span class="c16">れる -
Potential</span></h2>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">For example, the
potential.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">When we say "本が 読める", we're saying
"the book does readable."</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span style=
"overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 624.00px; height: 350.67px;">
<img alt="" src="images/image35.jpg" style=
"width: 624.00px; height: 350.67px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);"
title=""></span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">We can't translate this directly
into English because it's a verb and "readable"isn't a verb in
English, but in Japanese we're saying "the book does readable."Now
this is the subjectivity in a certain sense because it's not
talking about the fact that it's in general possible to read the
book.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">That would be "kanousei".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">It's talking about the fact that the
book is readable to a person or people in particular.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">But again, the が marked subject is
the book.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So saying "I can read the book"or
"we can read the book"is simply false.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">That's not what the sentence is
doing and if we think it is, we're going to end up with this
completely destructive idea thatが can sometimes mark the object of
a sentence. It never can.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">It can only ever mark the subject,
the A-car of a sentence.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And this is so crucial to Japanese
because it's what every single sentence you ever see, ever in your
whole life, consists of: a が marked A-[car] and a
B-engine.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Disrupt that and you've disrupted
everything.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So, the actor of "本が 読める" is the
book: "the book does readable." but if we say "私が 読める"or "さくらが
読める", what we're saying is "I can read"/ "Sakura can read."Not can
read a particular book, not can read a newspaper, not can read a
manga, but can read, is literate.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So, once again, the potential can
flip its polarity.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">If there's a specific readable
thing, then it's that that "does readable", but if there isn't, if
it's just referring to literacy in general, then it flips polarity
and points to the person or people who are able to read.</span></p>
<h2 class="c22" id="h.lefg4nea8e67"><span class="c16">Changing
perspective</span></h2>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Now why is this? We've talked about
the fact that the non-egocentricity of Japanese is fundamentally
rooted in a more animist way of seeing the world.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">I'm not saying anything here about
what Japanese people as individuals believe nowadays.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">I'm talking about how the language
looks at the world.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">English requires an ego at the
center; Japanese doesn't.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">It's much more happy to have non-ego
actors as the center of even a subjective-based
sentence.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">But it doesn't stop
there.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And once you realize that, we've
done away with the final problem.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">It's not just that it doesn't find
having a non-ego actor at the center and that in many cases it has
a preference for that, it's also that it sees the two, the inducer
of the subjectivity and the receiver, the experiencer, of the
subjectivity, as not fundamentally separate.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">The action of subjectively desiring
or fearing or wanting etc. is something that goes on between the
two, between the inducer and the experiencer.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And we can look at it from either
perspective and it doesn't really matter.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">The bias, as it were, the default
condition, is to attribute it to the inducer, but there's no
difficulty at all in moving it to the experiencer.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Because the two aren't regarded as
completely separate.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">They are two halves of the same
action.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And if we understand this, we're
looking at it much more through Japanese eyes.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">We're not having to re-route it
through strange English intermediaries.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And this affects all kinds of
things, not just the grammatical areas we've talked about, but all
kinds of things.</span></p>
<h2 class="c22" id="h.8337z0eyz915"><span class=
"c16">そう</span></h2>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">For example, let's take the word
"fushigi". "Fushigi" means "mystery". It's a noun, it means
"mystery". And it can be used as an adjectival noun, in which case
it means something like "mysterious".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So if we say "fushigi na や shiki",
we're saying "mysterious mansion".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">But we can also attach "そう" to
"fushigi", which, as we've discussed before, means "seems"or
"like".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So "fushigisou" would seem to mean
"seems mysterious"or "mysterious-like".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Now, this in itself is meaningless,
because "mysterious"is a subjectivity.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">If we say something is mysterious,
this isn't an objective quality like being red or being three feet
high.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">It's a subjectivity. It's mysterious
because we find it mysterious. If we don't find it mysterious, then
it's not mysterious.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So saying it's mysterious-like or
seems mysterious is meaningless because saying it's mysterious in
the first place is really only saying that.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">But that isn't what "fushigisou"
means.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Fushigisou"is used in sentences
like "これは naani to Sakuraは fushigisouに itta" -- "'What's this?'
asked Sakura in a mystified manner."</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span style=
"overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 624.00px; height: 350.67px;">

title=""></span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;"Fushigisou", you see, again
flips polarity.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">It doesn't apply to the thing which
is inducing the sense of mystery, it applies to the person feeling
the sense of mystery.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So "fushigisou" means something like
"mystified", sometimes perhaps "puzzled", but in any case it means
"perceiving quality of 'fushigi' in something else".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So you see this whole flipping of
polarity, which is based in a more unified view of the world, not
just more "animist", to use that term, but unified.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">More in a sense that the inside and
the outside are not wholly separate but are two sides of the same
perception.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span>And if we can grasp that, the final problem is
solved and a whole area of Japanese is unlocked and released from
the necessity of routing it through English.</span></p>

How to use natural Japanese: chau, chatta, how they really work

How to use natural Japanese: chau, chatta, how they really work
&nbsp;ちゃう、ちゃった | Lesson 44</a></span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">こんにちは. Today we're going to talk
about something that you encounter all the time in anime, manga,
everyday conversation, light novels, and anywhere that you
encounter real, so-called casual -- that's to say, non-formal --
Japanese.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Now, we're going to have to use a
little trick to understand from an English point of view how this
works.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And of course the standard
explanations wouldn't give you a trick like this because they don't
even explain the basics of the underlying principles of Japanese
structure.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So we get the effect of the three
blind men and the elephant.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">I'm sure you've heard the
story.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">The first one feels one of the
elephant's legs and says an elephant's like a tree, the second one
feels its trunk and says it's like a snake, the third one feels its
tail and says that it's like a rope.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And of course none of these are
exactly incorrect.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">The elephant does manifest all these
qualities, but if you present them as isolated facts without
explaining that there's an elephant underlying the whole thing,
which makes sense of it, you're making everything a great deal more
difficult than it needs to be.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And the standard English so-called
Japanese grammar does this from the very beginning with the
structure of the language, which is disastrous, and then it does it
again, and again, and again with what it calls "grammar
points".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And the very fact that it calls them
"grammar points"is part of the problem, because for the most part
these aren't in fact points, they are logical structures, and if we
understand the structure we don't have to memorize them as separate
meaningless "points".</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span>So</span><span>, what</span><span class=
"c1">&nbsp;we're going to discuss today are the expressions
"ちゃった"or "じゃった", which are attached to the end of verbs.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Now if we look at the conventional
explanations, we will read that it indicates an action that's been
finished or completed, or an action that we regret or did by
accident, or something that just happened unexpectedly.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">They don't usually add to this that
it can also indicate something that happened that was very good, or
that it can in fact be used in the future tense as "-chau"or
"-jau", which would seem to contradict everything that we've just
learned, wouldn't it? So, instead of looking at the tail and the
legs and the trunk, let's start by taking a look at the actual
elephant.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">First of all, "-chau"or "ちゃった"is in
fact a contraction of the past tense of the word "shimau", which
means to finish or complete.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span style=
"overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 624.00px; height: 350.67px;">
<img alt="" src="images/image318.jpg" style=

title=""></span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So, if you ever listen to Japanese
fairy tales, you'll find that they often end with the formula
"oshimai".</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span style=
"overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 624.00px; height: 350.67px;">
<img alt="" src="images/image202.jpg" style=
"width: 624.00px; height: 350.67px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);"
title=""></span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And "shimai"is the い-stem, which
makes it a noun of "shimau", so it means "the finish / the ending /
the end".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Now, if you put that into the past
tense, it's "shimatta", and "shimatta"can be used all on its own as
an expression, and it usually means "Something's gone very wrong /
This is not at all satisfactory": "Shimatta!"</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Perhaps the best way to put that in
English would be to say something like "that's done it"or "that's
the end!"or something like that.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Now, we can then use this "shimatta"
as a helper verb that we put onto the て-form of another verb. And
the way we do that is, we put the other word into て-form and then
we add "shimatta". And "て-shimatta"gets contracted down to
"ちゃった".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Now, if the て-form is "で "(as we
know that it is in some words and if you don't understand that,
I've explained it in a previous video), if the て-form is "で "then
instead of becoming "ちゃった", it becomes "じゃった", just in the way that
"de wa" becomes "ja".</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Now, this has a much wider range of
meanings than just "shimatta"on its own.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">It can be used for things that we
did by accident or that we wish we hadn't done.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">For example, we often say
"wasurechatta", which is "wasureru" -- "forget"-- plus
"ちゃった".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">There's a famous song "猫 funjatta",
which is great fun, and I'll put a link in the information section
below.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And what that means is "I trod on
the cat": "fumu"-- to "tread (on something)".</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So we can see that it has a negative
sense here, but it can also be something very good.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">We might say "Suupaahiirooに
nachatta" -- "I became a superhero."</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So what do these things have it
common? Accidental things, things we regret, things we're very
pleased about.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">The way I would put this, the way I
would translate this into English, because this is the English
expression that I think covers practically all cases of "ちゃった", is
the word "done".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">" wasurechatta" -- "I done forgot" ;
"猫 funjatta" -- "I done trod on the cat" ; "Suupaaheerooに nachatta"
-- "I done became a superhero."In all these cases , the idea is
very similar.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">We're saying that it happened, it's
done, it's completed, it's a fact, and the implication generally
speaking is that we didn't expect it to be a fact or it wasn't what
most people would normally have expected to be a fact, but it is.
It done happened.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And if we understand that, it's very
easy to understand all the different kinds of circumstances under
which "ちゃった"gets used.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">The only real difference between
this and "done"in English is that we don't only use it about past
things.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">We also use it about future
things.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So we can say, "natsu や sumiが
owatteshimau" and that means "the summer vacation will done
end".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Now, of course you can't say that in
English but that essentially is what you're saying.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">It will just be and go and
end.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">That's what'll happen and it'll be
done and there's nothing we'll be able to do about it.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">If you're about to tell somebody
something embarrassing, you might say "kimiは waracchau darou" --
"You'll probably laugh"or "You'll probably done laugh / You'll
probably just up and laugh." again, it's the same idea but in
Japanese we can project that idea into the future as
well.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">We can say "Kyouは dondon nonjau",
and that's "today, I'm going to drink like crazy".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Dondon"is "one after another in
rapid succession" ; "nonjau"is "done drink".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Again, we can't put that in the
future in English, but we can put in in the future in
Japanese.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So if we understand how these work,
we don't have to have a lot of complicated explanations of all
their different cases.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span>They work in the same way all the time if we
only think about what is the way they work rather than what their
end result is if you translate it into English.</span></p>

Japanese Word Order MATTERS (more than you think) 2 Simple rules
crack tough sentences | Lesson 46</a></span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">こんにちは.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Today we're going to talk about
Japanese word order, because this is something really
fundamental.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">As sentences become more complex,
word order becomes more and more necessary in order to understand
exactly what's going on in any given sentence.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And, as is often the case,
English-language so-called Japanese grammar doesn't give us very
much help with this.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">If you look up "Japanese word
order"on the Internet, you'll find that there are broadly two
different opinions being promulgated.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">The first is that Japanese is an SOV
language, that's a Subject-Object-Verb language.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And the second is that word order in
Japanese really doesn't matter and isn't very important, because
you can put words in pretty much any order and continue to mean the
same thing.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And both of these opinions are
completely false.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And interestingly enough although
they're diametrically opposed to each other, they both stem from
the same fallacy. They both come from giving different answers to
the same question which was the wrong question to ask in the first
place.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">In other words, what they come from
is our old friend, treating Japanese as if it were not Japanese but
a European language and asking questions and giving answers that
are relevant to European languages and not to Japanese.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So, let's look into this and see how
it works and understand how word order really works in
Japanese.</span></p>
<h2 class="c22" id="h.r0e2n3w46liq"><span class="c16">Word order
and particles</span></h2>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">First of all, let's look at this
question of Japanese being a Subject-Object-Verb
language.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Now, this would be contrasting it to
English, which is a Subject-Verb-Object language.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So, to give you an example of that,
if we say "Mary hit Susan", this is a standard English
Subject-Verb-Object sentence.</span></p>

<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Mary is the Subject -- she did the
hitting.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Susan is the Object -- she received
the hitting.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">If we change the order around and
say "Susan hit Mary", we're now saying something different, aren't
we?</span></p>
<p class="c19 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Now, the way in Japanese we would
say "Mary hit Susan"is "Maryが Susan を nagutta".</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span style=
"overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 624.00px; height: 350.67px;">

<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And this is of course
Subject-Object-Verb.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Mary's the Subject, Susan's the
Object, and the Verb comes at the end.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So, isn't Wikipedia right? Isn't
Japanese really a Subject-Object-Verb language? No, it
isn't.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Because although "Maryが Susan を
nagutta"is the most common way of putting it, it isn't the only way
of putting it.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">We could just as easily say "Susan を
Maryが nagutta" and we're still saying "Mary hit Susan", even though
we've changed the order.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span style=

title=""></span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Because in Japanese the question of
who did what to whom and most other logical questions like where it
was done, what it was done with, and all those things are handled
by logical particles.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So the important thing in this
sentence is not which order we have Mary and Susan but which one is
marked byが and which one is marked by を.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So this talk of a
Subject-Object-Verb language is nonsense.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">It doesn't actually matter which
order you put them in.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And this of course is the basis of
these people who say Japanese word order doesn't matter.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So aren't they right? No, they're
not right.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Because Japanese word order does
matter.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">It just doesn't matter in the same
ways and the same places that European word order
matters.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">If we start thinking about Japanese
as Japanese and not trying to interpret it as a European language,
then we can make some progress on actually understanding
Japanese.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So what is Japanese word order and
why does it matter so much? Japanese word order goes according to
two simple rules.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">They're both very simple.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">It's just that they don't work in
the same way that European languages work.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So if we can throw our European
concepts out of the window and start looking at Japanese as
Japanese, there's nothing difficult about this.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">It's very simple and straightforward
to understand.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So, what are the two rules of
Japanese word order?</span></p>
<h2 class="c22" id="h.lst84j5q7fpf"><span class="c16">First
Rule</span></h2>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">The first one you probably already
know.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">It's very simple, and I expect you
use it all the time if you're actually using Japanese at all even
at a very basic level.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">The first rule of Japanese word
order is: The Engine always goes at the end of the
sentence.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Now, if I were talking in this very
verb-centered English way, I would say "the Verb always goes at the
end of the sentence", and that's perfectly true.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">The Verb always does go at the end
of the sentence.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">But not all sentences are
verb-sentences, "a does B"sentences.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">We also have "a is
B"sentences.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And whatever kind of sentence we
have, the Engine always goes at the end of the sentence.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">There are three possible kinds of
Engine.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span style=
"overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 624.00px; height: 350.67px;">
<img alt="" src="images/image150.jpg" style=
"width: 624.00px; height: 350.67px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);"
title=""></span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">There is the Verb Engine, which is
an "a does B"sentence.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And then with "a is B"sentences we
either have an Adjective Engine, an engine made from an adjective
which always ends in -i (this is what the textbooks call an
"い-Adjective" and is in fact the only adjective there is in
Japanese) or with a Noun plus the Copula, which is "だ" or
"です".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So every sentence is going to end in
one of those three.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And whatever Engine we're using, a
Verb, a Noun with the Copula, or an Adjective, it has to go at the
end.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">We may have a couple of
sentence-ender particles after it (and I've done a video on
sentence-ender particles) but the actual end of the logical
sentence has to be its Engine.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So that's the first rule, and it's
very easy, and I imagine you're accustomed to it
already.</span></p>
<h2 class="c22" id="h.pqobwcxzk7i6"><span class="c16">Second
rule</span></h2>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">The second rule is this, and this is
the one that can cause confusion if you don't understand it:
Anything that modifies any-thing must go before it.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span style=
"overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 624.00px; height: 350.67px;">
<img alt="" src="images/image260.jpg" style=
"width: 624.00px; height: 350.67px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);"
title=""></span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Now what do I mean by "anything" and
"any-thing" and what do I mean by "modify"? Let's break it
down.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">By "any-thing"I mean literally a
thing, a noun. We're talking about nouns at the moment.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And by "anything", I really mean
anything. It could be a logical clause, it could be part of a
logical clause, it could be another noun -- it's anything that
modifies any noun.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So what do I mean by "modify"? Well,
I mean literally changing something or, we could say, describing
it.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So if we have a dress and then we
put a modifier before it and say it's a "blue dress", then we've
modified it -- we've made it blue.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">If we say it's a "big dress" then
we've modified it and made it big.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">If we say it's a " hot dress" then
we've modified it and made it hot.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And of course modifiers can become
more complex than that and we'll talk about that in just a
moment.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">But a modifier is something that
tells us more about a noun.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">It modifies it from just being the
simple noun to being a more particular version of that
noun.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So what do I mean by saying that
"anything that modifies any-thing must come before it"? Well, if we
speak English we should be used to this idea already, because in
English simple modifiers always come before the noun they
modify.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So, as we've just seen, if we say "a
blue dress", "blue"comes before the modified noun "dress", the noun
that we've just turned blue.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">We say "a warm day".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">" warm"comes before the noun
"day".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And it can become more
complex.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">We might say "a pale blue dress", "a
nice warm day", and the modifier still comes before the noun it's
modifying.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And it can get more complicated
still.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">We might say "an interesting-looking
pale blue dress", and all of it still comes before the noun
"dress", doesn't it?</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">However, when modifiers become more
complex in English we start throwing them on the other side of the
noun.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So if we want to say "the dress I
bought at the market on Saturday", now "dress"comes first and the
modifier comes afterward.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And sometimes we're throwing
modifiers onto both sides of the noun.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So we might say, "the pale blue
dress I bought at the market yesterday".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So we've got "dress"sandwiched in
the middle and clauses modifying that dress on both sides of
it.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">That's not the way Japanese
works.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Japanese always keeps modifiers
before the thing they modify.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So it's very predictable and we
always know what's going on.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">A way of looking at Japanese word
order is to see it as a stage scene.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">To see every sentence or every
logical clause as a little scene on a stage.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And the way Japanese works is that
first of all it dresses the little dolls that go into the
scene.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So before each doll comes whatever
it's dressed in, whatever modifies it, whatever tells us more about
it, its clothes, its setting.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span style=
"overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 624.00px; height: 350.67px;">

title=""></span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Then we put it on the
stage.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">We mark it with whatever part it
plays in the sentence, and then we put the next noun if there is
another noun, and finally we put on the action button, the
verb.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And we always press the action
button last.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So this is the order of Japanese
sentences.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">First of all, the information about
the actors.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Then the actors
themselves.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And if there's more than one actor,
we put its information first and then the actor, and the next one
we put its information first and then the actor.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And then finally, if it's an action
scene, if it's an "a does B"scene, then we put on the action button
and we watch the actors going through their parts.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And from the word order we can
always tell what's happening.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">If we have a clause that ends in one
of the Engines, a Verb, an Adjective or a Noun plus Copula, we know
that that is a logical clause.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span style=
"overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 624.00px; height: 350.67px;">

title=""></span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">But if it's turned around in any
way, if it's ending in a noun and not in an Engine, then we know
that the noun at the head of that clause is a modified noun and the
clause is not functioning as a logical clause.</span></p>
<h2 class="c22" id="h.kcd9thjn6c8q"><span class=
"c16">Examples</span></h2>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Let's take the example we've been
looking at.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">If we say "ichibaで &nbsp;青い ドレス を
katta", we're saying "I bought a blue dress at the
market."</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span style=
"overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 624.00px; height: 350.67px;">
<img alt="" src="images/image53.jpg" style=
"width: 624.00px; height: 350.67px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);"
title=""></span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And we know that that's a logical
clause because of Rule One.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So this is a logical clause ending
with an Engine.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">It's an "a does B"clause: "I bought
a blue dress at the market."</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Now, we can move almost any element
from a logical clause to the front of the clause, that's to say, to
the position nearest the Engine, furthest right in horizontal text,
furthest down in vertical text.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">We can move it to the head of the
clause and if we do that, if we move any non-Engine element to the
head of the clause, then it's no longer functioning as a logical
clause, but it's functioning as a modifier for that element that
we've moved to the head.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So, if we say, "一場で買った ドレス", we're
saying "the dress I bought at the market".</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span style=
"overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 624.00px; height: 350.67px;">
<img alt="" src="images/image269.jpg" style=

title=""></span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">This is no longer a logical
clause.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">It's a modified noun, and the noun
is the dress.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Now, we can just as easily bring the
market to the head of the clause.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">We can say, "ドレス を katta ichiba",
and now we're saying "the market at which I bought the
dress".</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span style=
"overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 624.00px; height: 350.67px;">
<img alt="" src="images/image305.jpg" style=

title=""></span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And again, we know this isn't a
logical clause because it doesn't have an Engine at the
head.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">At the head it has a noun, and so
that noun must be modified by what is going before it.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And since it's not a logical clause,
in order to make a logical clause we have to have something else
after it.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And that again could contain
modifications.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Because Japanese does things with
these modifications that in other languages are done in other
ways.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So almost any complex Japanese
sentence is going to be heavily dependent on these
pre-modifiers.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And knowing what is modifying, what
is being modified, knowing whether something is a modified noun or
whether we're looking at a logical clause -- all this is dependent
on word order.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So, the full clause here might be:
"一場で買ったドレスをメガネをかけている少女にあげた."</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span style=
"overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 624.00px; height: 350.67px;">
<img alt="" src="images/image66.jpg" style=
"width: 624.00px; height: 350.67px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);"
title=""></span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So then we're saying, "I gave the
dress that I bought at the market to a girl wearing
glasses."</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And once again, we have what could
be a logical clause -- "少女は megane を kakete いる", "the girl is
wearing glasses"-- but we've taken the noun "shojo" -- "girl"-- to
the front, so now it's not a logical clause, it's a noun with a
modifier, the girl modified by the phrase "megane を kakete いる" --
"girl wearing glasses".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"I gave the dress I bought at the
market to a girl wearing glasses." and this is very
typical.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">You're going to see this kind of
construction all the time.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">The way Japanese does a awful lot of
the work of conveying things is by using these modifying clauses,
which always come before whatever it is they're
modifying.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">First of all we dress the doll, then
we put the doll on the stage, then we press the action
button.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span>So, word order is crucial to understanding
Japanese.</span></p>

secret weapon that will allow you to grasp any Japanese sentence
regardless of how complex it may appear to be.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">A lot of Japanese sentences in fact
appear much more complicated than they really are because of what I
call the modular or modification structure of the
language.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">But once we understand how it really
works this structure stops being our enemy and becomes our friend,
because it allows us to break down any complicated Japanese
sentence into something that's really laughably simple.</span></p>
<h2 class="c22" id="h.zcl2hvu3crri"><span class="c16">Clauses and
Sentences</span></h2>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">I told you right from the beginning
of this course that every Japanese sentence consists of two
elements, and they are the A-car (the subject) and the
B-engine.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">The A-car is always marked by
が.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">We can't always see it, but whether
we can see it or not, it's always logically there and it's always
marked by が.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">The B-engine can be one of only
three things. It can be a verb, an adjective, or a noun-plus-copula
"だ" or "です".</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">There are only two kinds of
sentence: "A is B" and "A does B" sentences.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">In an "A does B" sentence, A is the
thing that does B, which is the engine, which has to be a
verb.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">In an "A is B" sentence, A is the
thing which is B, which has to be an adjective or a
noun-plus-copula.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Now, we've seen much more
complicated sentences since then and we've seen how every one of
them has this same A and B as its fundamental core.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">But the important thing we are going
to look at today is the fact that A and B are not just the core of
the sentence: they are the sentence.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Everything else is doing nothing
other than telling us something more about A or something more
about B.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Now, the only other thing that can
complicate this at times is the fact that when we say "a sentence"
what we actually mean is a logical clause.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span>Now, we sometimes use those two terms
interchangeably and we very often can use them interchangeably, but
the difference is this: a logical clause is by definition a
complete sentence, that's to say, we could put a
"。”(</span><span class="c38">まる</span><span class="c1">) or a
period at the end of it and then it's a sentence.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">It can stand on its own; it's
grammatical; it doesn't need anything else.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">It is a sentence.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">But the reason we call it "a logical
clause" is because a sentence can contain more than one logical
clause.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">That's to say, it can contain within
itself two elements that could each be a complete
sentence.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Now, a very simple example of this
is if we say "お店に行ってパンを買った", which in English is "I went to the
shops and bought bread."</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span style=
"overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 624.00px; height: 350.67px;">
<img alt="" src="images/image72.jpg" style=
"width: 624.00px; height: 350.67px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);"
title=""></span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Now, in both English and Japanese,
this is two logical clauses made into one compound
sentence.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And I've talked about compound
sentences in another video.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So what we have here is the logical
clause "お店に行った" -- "I went to the shops"-- and "パンを買った" -- "I
bought bread".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">In English this is "I went to the
shops and I bought bread".</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Now, in Japanese we don't need to
have the "I" visible but it has to be logically there and it
logically carries the particle が.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">We sometimes say that English
requires the subject to be visibly present in every clause, but
this isn't actually true, although it's close to being
true.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And this is an example of how it
isn't always true.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">English actually does use the zero
pronoun just as Japanese does.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">It just doesn't do it nearly so
often.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So with this sentence in English we
don't normally say "I went to the shops and I bought some
bread".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">We usually say "I went to the shops
and bought some bread".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So you see here that English is
actually using the zero pronoun.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">We don't have to say "I" twice.
We're allowed to carry it over from context to the second clause of
the sentence just the way Japanese much more freely allows us to do
that.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">But in all cases the subject is
there. Bread isn't buying itself. I'm buying it, whether I am
visibly there as the subject or not.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So one skill that we need for
understanding a complex sentence is the ability to see where
logical clauses end, to see when something is in fact a complete
logical clause with its own A-car and B-engine.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And I've done a whole video
explaining how to do that, so you may want to watch that video
after you see this one.</span></p>
<h2 class="c22" id="h.mclqr8g20tp3"><span>Modifiers</span></h2>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Today we're going to concentrate on
the logical clause and the ways in which it can apparently become
complicated.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Last week we were talking about the
concept of modifiers and we were talking about it in its perhaps
simplest and most approachable form, which is
noun-modifiers.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And to understand modifiers you have
to understand word order in Japanese because Japanese word order is
extremely important.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">As sentences become more complex,
you have to understand word order to understand what they're
doing.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So these people who tell you that
Japanese has no set word order or that Japanese is an SOV language
are really leading you up the garden path because neither of those
statements is true, as we discussed last week.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So the first law of Japanese word
order is that the engine of the sentence, which can be a verb, an
adjective or a noun-plus-copula, always has to come at the end of
the sentence.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And a second law, and this is the
most important one for our present purposes, is that anything that
modifies anything has to come before it.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Now, last week, the form I put this
in was "anything that modifies any *thing* has to come before it",
that's to say, anything that modifies a noun has to come before
that noun.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">But we can take this further, and
that's what we're going to do this week.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And we can simply say "anything that
modifies ANYTHING always comes before it". It doesn't have to be a
noun.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">What else could it be? Well, it
could be the head verb of the sentence.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So, let's go back to a somewhat
complex sentence that we analyzed last week.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class=
"c1">"一場で買ったドレスをメガネをかけている少女にあげた."-</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">- "I gave the dress I bought at the
market to a girl wearing glasses."</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span style=
"overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 624.00px; height: 350.67px;">
<img alt="" src="images/image47.jpg" style=
"width: 624.00px; height: 350.67px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);"
title=""></span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Now, I colored this in order to show
the process of noun modification.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">In this sentence we have the A-car,
which is invisible (it's "I'', zeroが), and we have the engine,
which is "あげた".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And that is the sentence core: "I
gave".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Now, inside the sentence we have two
nouns and they're both modified by more information.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And in both cases that information
is given by taking a logical clause and pulling out one element and
putting it at the head of the sentence, at the engine end of the
sentence.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So we could say "一場で買った" and then we
have the engine at the end and we're saying "I bought a dress at
the market", but we can also pull out any element from that
sentence and put it at the end and that becomes a modified
noun.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So we can say, as we're saying here,
"一場で買ったドレス", which means "the dress I bought at the
market".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">We could also do the same thing with
the market: "ドレス を買った一場" -- "the market at which I bought the
dress".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And neither of these is a logical
clause, because it couldn't stand on its own as a sentence, could
it? It's now a noun which has to play some role in a larger
sentence.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So, the blue elements here are the
modifiers, the red elements are nouns that are marked with logical
particles.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And here is this fundamental radical
fact that you need to take a moment to ingest.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">In an "a does B" sentence, the nouns
marked by the main logical particles other than が, that is, by を,
に, で , and へ, are all modifiers for the verb.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">The logical particle が tells us what
the subject of the sentence is, what the A-car is.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">The logical particle の is an
exception here because what it does is couple two nouns.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">But the main verb-sentence logical
particles, を, に, で , and -he, do one thing and one thing
only.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">They modify the verb; they tell us
more about it.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So in this sentence, the sentence
itself is "I gave", and then these modified nouns provide more
information about that verb "gave".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"I gave." what did I give? The
を-marked object tells us this: "I gave a dress".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">The modifier tells us more about the
dress: "the dress I bought at the market".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">To whom did I give it? The に marked
indirect object tells us that: "I gave it to a girl".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">What kind of a girl? Well, the
modifier tells us more about the girl: "the girl wearing
glasses".</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So, the sentence itself is "(zeroが)
あげた" and everything else is telling us more about "あげた".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And however long and complicated it
gets, that structure always stays the same.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">We have to identify the engine of
the sentence and that's very easy because the engine of the
sentence is invariably at the end of the sentence.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">It may have a couple of
sentence-ender particles after it (and I've done a video on that)
but the logical end of the sentence is the verb, the adjective or
the noun-plus-copula that is the last one in the
sentence.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So we always know where to find the
engine: it's at the end of the sentence.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And the A-car is whoever is doing
that verb or being that adjective or noun-plus-copula.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Now the other useful thing to
remember is that it's usually easy enough to find even an invisible
actor because it's not going to have anything behind it.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">In this sentence, as we see, there's
a lot of modifying going on but it's all modifying the
verb.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">We can't have anything modifying the
A-car, the が marked actor, because the が marked actor isn't visible
and we can only modify something that we can actually see within a
sentence.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So if we wanted to modify both
elements of the sentence we'd need to make the first one
visible.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Let's try doing that.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">" ano Sakura を nagutta minikui
gaikokujinは 私が 一場で買ったドレスをメガネをかけている少女にあげた." -- "that ugly foreigner
who hit Sakura gave the dress I bought at the market to a girl
wearing glasses."</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span style=
"overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 624.00px; height: 350.67px;">

title=""></span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Now we're starting the sentence out
with a non-logical topic marked by は .</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">But what that topic is doing is
defining for us the zero pronoun, the が marked A-car of the
sentence, which is zeroが.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Now, we could say, "minikui
gaikokujinが Sakura を nagutta"--" an ugly foreigner hit Sakura"--
but what we're doing here once again is we're pulling out one of
the elements, in this case "gaikokujin", and putting it at the end
of the clause, so it isn't a functional logical clause, it's a
modified noun: "the ugly gaikokujin who hit Sakura".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So it's telling us more about that
gaikokujin: "as for that ugly gaikokujin who hit Sakura, he did..."
what did he do? " he did.."-- that's "zeroが" -- " he did..." and
then we say what he did.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And let's notice that everything,
everything in this sentence apart from the core consists of what we
might call "serial modification".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Even the word "gaikokujin", which is
so often seen together that we tend to regard it as a word in
itself, and it is a word in itself, is in fact an example of serial
modification, one thing modifying the thing that comes after
it.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span style=
"overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 624.00px; height: 350.67px;">

title=""></span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So, "koku"is the on-reading of
"kuni" -- "country".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Gaikoku"-- in "gaikoku",
"gai"modifies "koku".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">What kind of a country was it? An
"outside"country, a "foreign"country.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And then, "jin", which is the
on-reading of " hito" -- "person"-- is modified by these two
together.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">What kind of a person was it? An
"outside-country"person, a person "from a foreign country" --
"gaikokujin".</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So, everything in this sentence is
modifying whatever comes after it, until we get to the A-car, and
then we have the first fundamental element of the sentence, and
then everything after that is then modifying the engine.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And that's all that can ever
happen.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">This is how every Japanese sentence
is structured.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">We have the A-car, we have the
B-engine.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">If there's anything modifying the
A-car it comes directly before it.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">If there's anything modifying the
B-engine, it comes directly before that.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Every noun marked with a main
logical particle, the detectives of our logical particle video: を,
に, で and -he, are in fact modifying the verb.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">They're telling us more about the
verb, and I said in that video that these logical particles --
other than が, which gives us the subject of any sentence, and -no,
which links together two nouns -- these four fundamental logical
particles only work in verb-sentences, "a does
B"sentences.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Or, in detective terms, they only
work on cases.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And that's because their function is
to tell us more about the verb, to modify the verb.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So, every sentence has this same
structure: the A-car, the B-engine, the things that are modifying
the A-car, and the things that are modifying the
B-engine.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span style=

<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And there's nothing else that can be
in a sentence except for things like sentence-ender
particles.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">But there may be more than one
logical clause operating in a sentence and, as I say, identifying
logical clauses is not complicated.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">There's a very straightforward
technique for that as well, but that isn't the subject of this
video.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span>So for that one you need to go to the video on
that particular subject.</span></p>

Dealing with ambiguity in Japanese 3 Laws that Make Everything
Clear! Lesson 48</a></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">こんにちは.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Today we're going to talk about
ambiguity in Japanese, because this is something that makes the
language much harder to understand for many non-Japanese
learners.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Now, Japanese has a reputation for
being an ambiguous language.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And whether this is true or not, the
perception of ambiguity makes sentences harder to
understand.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So, I want to look at real and
perceived ambiguity in Japanese and how to deal with it.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Japanese people don't have any
difficulty in understanding each other, and there's no reason for
you to have any difficulty either.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">A lot of the perceived difficulty
comes from the fact that it's taught in such a way as not to
explain the real structure of the language.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So let's look at some different
aspects of real and perceived Japanese ambiguity.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Probably the first thing that makes
Japanese feel ambiguous and difficult to foreigners is the zero
pronoun.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">It's so confusing to many people
that there are intelligent and respectable teachers of Japanese on
the Web who even go so far as to claim that Japanese has no
grammatical subject.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">It certainly has a grammatical
subject and it's present in every sentence.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">The thing is that you can't always
see it.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Now, I've explained before that this
is really that the Japanese invisible pronoun (or zero pronoun) is
no more confusing than English "it".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">The word "it"could mean the
Andromeda galaxy, it could mean a tree, it could mean my kneecap (I
do have kneecaps), it could mean a chimpanzee's tail, assuming
chimpanzees do have tails, and even if they don't it could be an
imaginary chimpanzee's tail.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">The point is that because "it"can
mean just about everything, it actually means nothing except in
context.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And that's exactly how the zero
pronoun works.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And one is no more ambiguous than
the other.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">But some people are going to say,
"but the fact that you can't see it means that we don't even know
whether it's there or not." and the answer to that is that yes, we
can know.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So long as we understand the
structure of the language, we know it's there because it has to be
there.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">It's logically there.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So there's no difficulty at all
about pinpointing the zero pronoun provided we understand the
structure of the language.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And one of the difficulties of
course is that conventional Japanese grammar textbooks and websites
don't teach the real structure of the language and so they leave us
in doubt on this as on many other subjects.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">But that's what my course is for, so
if you follow my course or have followed my course you should be
clear enough about the structure of the language.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So, can the zero pronoun ever cause
ambiguity? Yes, it can.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Just as "it"can in
English.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">For example, if I say, "My right
antenna was so broken that it fell off" (you haven't seen my
antennae, have you? Well, they're a bit of a secret, so let's pass
on) "My right antenna was so broken that it fell off", you know
from context that "it"refers to my right antenna.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">But suppose I say, "I was trying to
fix the door handle, but my right antenna was so broken that it
fell off." then you may not know whether I mean that my right
antenna fell off or that the door handle fell off.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And this kind of ambiguity can occur
in any language, and really no more in Japanese than any other
language.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">What do we do about it when it does
occur? Well, fundamentally it's up to the speaker to make herself
clear or the listener to ask her to clarify if she hasn't made
herself clear.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">If you're watching anime, reading
books or playing games or in general dealing with any kind of
professional writing or speaking, people will make things clear
unless they actually want to play games with ambiguity.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So this is just the same as English
or any other language.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">There's nothing special about
Japanese in this context.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">If we go back to the example we used
right back in our first lesson about the non-logical は topic
marker, "私は うなぎ です".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"私は アメリカ人 です" means "I am an
American.""私は うなぎ です"does not usually mean "I am an eel."If it's
spoken in a restaurant and the topic of conversation is what we're
going to eat, then it'll be understood that the zero pronoun of
that sentence is not "私" but the thing we're talking about: what
we're going to have to eat.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Could it ever mean "I am an eel"?
Yes, it could.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">For example, if I go up to a
stranger in the street and point to my nose (which is the way in
Japan you indicate yourself) and say, "私は うなぎ です", they would know
that I'm saying that I'm an eel and they'd probably think I was a
little strange, because I don't look like a eel.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">I look a bit like a human but I hope
not very much like an eel.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Now, if in a restaurant we weren't
talking about food at all, maybe about the weather, and I suddenly
say "私は うなぎ だ" , people would probably still understand me to mean
that I have decided I want to eat eel.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So, how does this work? Well, in
Japanese -- and it's just the same in English or any other language
-- we have three rules that we apply to interpreting sentences that
can be in any way ambiguous.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And they are: context, probability,
and the absurdity rule.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Context is the obvious one that
we've already discussed.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">If I say "My left antenna was so
broken that it fell off", you know from context that "it" means my
left antenna.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Probability is the fact that when
two possibilities are both possible and context hasn't actually
told us which, we'll go for the one that's most
probable.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And this isn't just an
accident.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">This is something everybody knows
about language.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So listeners do it, speakers expect
listeners to do it, and language is tailored to work with those
rules -- in Japanese or in English.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So there's nothing mysterious about
it.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So, for example, if I say "I saw a
man on a hill with a telescope", probably you would interpret this
as meaning I used the telescope in order to see the man on the
hill.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So that's probability, I haven't
actually said anything to indicate that interpretation, but it's
the most likely default interpretation.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">However, if you said to me, "Do you
think we're being watched?" and I said, "I think we are.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">I saw a man on a hill with a
telescope", then you would probably interpret me as saying that I
saw, with my naked eye, a man on a hill who had a telescope and
therefore was probably watching us.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Now, there are other interpretations
too.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">I could have meant I saw a man on a
hill that had one of these public payてlescopes on it, so "a hill
with a telescope" would be where I saw the man.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And one could even mean that I use a
telescope as a saw to cut a man on a hill.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Now, the last one, like "I am an
eel", is somewhat absurd and so that comes very low down the scale
of anybody's making that interpretation.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And the absurdity rule is that the
burden of expression lies with absurdity.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And this is similar to the legal
dictum that the burden of proof lies with the
prosecution.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">In other words, we assume the
defendant to be innocent unless we can prove that they were
guilty.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Similarly, we assume a statement not
to be absurd unless there is clear evidence that absurdity is
intended.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So, for example, "I ate dinner with
Sakura last night"is not generally considered to be an ambiguous
sentence.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"I ate dinner with chopsticks last
night"is also not considered to be an ambiguous
sentence.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">But you can see that they are
structured identically but they work differently.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Now, if I wanted to say "I ate
dinner with Sakura last night"meaning I used Sakura as an eating
implement or if I wanted to say "I ate dinner with chopsticks last
night"meaning a friendly animated pair of chopsticks was my dining
companion, it would be incumbent upon me to make that
clear.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">I cannot convey to you the idea that
I used Sakura as an eating implement by saying "I ate dinner with
Sakura last night".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">You will always put the more
probable and less absurd interpretation on it.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Language reserves the right, and
must reserve the right, to express the improbable and the
absurd.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Otherwise language would have whole
areas that it would be unable to express.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">But the further you go from the
norm, the higher is the incumbency upon the speaker to make what
she is saying clear.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So if I really want to say that I
used Sakura as an eating implement, I would have to say "I had
dinner last night and I used Sakura as a pair of chopsticks."
anything with any ambiguity at all is going to have the absurd
possibility ruled out.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Now, this isn't logic, it isn't
grammar, but it is the way human languages work -- English,
Japanese, any other language.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">To take a specific example in
Japanese, something that sometimes troubles people is the fact that
the godan potential helper verb "られる" and the receptive helper verb
"られる" are identical.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And people often think, "well, this
is really worrying.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">The two are the same.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">How am I ever going to know which is
which?" and part of the problem here comes from the whole textbook
approach to Japanese, which has to do with learning things in the
abstract and dealing with these cut-off, isolated, out-of-context
sentences.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Although we need to learn structure,
the way we learn Japanese is from immersion in Japanese, using real
in-context Japanese language.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So, let's look at this
"られる"problem.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">For example, "食べられる": "食べrareta", if
it's the potential, can mean either "I was able to eat"or "I was
able to eat (something) / I was able to eat (this particular
thing)".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">On the other hand, if it's the
receptive, it means "I received the action of eating".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">In English we would say "I was
eaten"or "I got eaten", which is closer to the Japanese.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">It tends to get translated as a
passive sentence -- "I was eaten"-- in English.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">What it actually means is literally
"I got eaten / I received the act of being eaten".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And if we think of it as passive,
we're going to get very messed-up with the structure of those
sentences.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">But that's not really the subject of
this video and you can watch my video on the Japanese receptive to
clarify all this.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">The ambiguity here is that if I say
"食べrareta"I could mean I was able to eat or I could mean I got
eaten.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Now, in this case the absurdity rule
comes into play: I could be saying that I was eaten but considering
that I'm standing here telling you that, it's not very
probable.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So I would have to say something
more than that in order to get you to register the possibility that
I could say that I had been eaten.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So this is a simple case where the
absurdity rule and the likelihood rule will determine what's being
said and from probabilities of the particular case we're talking
about.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">There can be cases where there's
real ambiguity.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">For example in the case of a pet
mouse.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">If we say "nezumiが 食べrareta", we
could mean that the mouse was able to eat something we gave her or
able to eat in general or it could unfortunately mean that the
mouse got eaten, perhaps by a cat.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">How do we resolve this ambiguity?
Well, we can't do it structurally.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Just as in the telescope case in
English, there are some cases where linguistic structural
ambiguities are only resolvable by external considerations, the
probabilities of the particular case.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Now, people tend to act as if there
were something special and strange about this happening in Japanese
that would freeze us and make us unable to understand, but that's
no more the case in Japanese than it is in English.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Japanese is not some magical
language ruled by strange, impenetrable rules.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">It's just a language, and it's a far
more logical language than English, but like all languages there
are many potential ambiguities, all of which are resolved by the
speaker, the listener and the situation.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Every now and again there is some
genuine ambiguity where somebody can misunderstand, but no more
than in English.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Most of the time people communicate
what they want to communicate without any difficulty, using both
the structure of the language and external probabilities -- and
also a knowledge of how the language works.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And to give an example of that, in
our last lesson we examined the sentence
"一場で買ったドレスをメガネをかけている少女にあげた." -- "I gave the dress I bought at the
market to a girl wearing glasses." and then we elaborated a more
complex sentence: "ano Sakura を nagutta minikui gaikokujinは 私が
一場で買ったドレスをメガネをかけている少女にあげた." and this means: "that ugly foreigner
who hit Sakura gave the dress I bought at the market to a girl
wearing glasses."Now, somebody asked me, " how do we know that the
first part of this, after 'the ugly foreigner', isn't working just
like the original sentence? How do we know that that '私が' isn't the
subject of the sentence? Because after all a wa-statement is a
non-logical statement.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">It doesn't have to be defining the
subject of the sentence.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">It may be just standing on its
own.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So how do we know that this second
part of the sentence doesn't just still mean 'I gave the dress I
bought at the market to a girl wearing glasses'?" and the answer to
that is a knowledge of how Japanese works.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Although wa-statements are not
logical, they are in fact grammatical.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">They're part of Japanese
grammar.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">When we make a wa-statement it has
to be related directly to the rest of what we're saying.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Even in English, for example, if we
were to say, "Speaking of the Andromeda galaxy, Sakura's got a
pimple on her nose", you'd be taken aback, wouldn't you? What has
Sakura's pimple got to do with the Andromeda galaxy? But in
Japanese it's even more so, because the wa-statement isn't just
saying "speaking of".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">It's actually a grammatical
connection.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So if I were to say, "Speaking of
that ugly foreigner who hit Sakura, I gave the dress I bought at
the market to a girl wearing glasses", that makes no
sense.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Why are we saying "speaking of the
ugly foreigner who hit Sakura"? Now, it's possible, it's possible,
just as it's possible for "私は うなぎ だ" to mean "I am an eel"under
certain circumstances, it's just possible, given surrounding
circumstances, given something the listener knows that connects the
two things together, that it could actually be working this
way.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">If, for example, it was because of
the ugly foreigner being there that we ended up giving the dress to
the girl wearing spectacles.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">But, once again the burden of proof
lies with the unlikely possibility.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Unless we have good reason to think
that there's some connection between the ugly foreigner who hit
Sakura and the fact that I gave the dress to a girl wearing
glasses, that's not the interpretation we're going to put on
it.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So again like the telescope sentence
in English, we interpret sentences not only according to their
strict structure but also according to the circumstances and the
likelihoods of the situation.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Because Japanese is a very logical
language, I think sometimes people expect that everything should be
determined by the structural logic of the language.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">But that isn't the case in
Japanese.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">It isn't the case in
English.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">It isn't the case in any
language.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So in order to interpret sentences
with possible ambiguity, we can do this 99% of the time.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">We do it in English; we can do it in
Japanese.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Japanese people do it in Japanese;
we can do it in Japanese.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">It's not a magical language with
strange, inscrutable connections.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">It's a language just like English in
this respect, that it works by structure but it also works by the
everyday common sense criteria of language, which look at context,
probability, and always rule out absurdity unless it's made very
clear that absurdity is intended.</span></p>

<h1 class="c15" id="h.m9iowtvlxll7"><span class="c18">Lesson 49:
Japanese Point-of-View Deconfused! -もらう・てもらう morau,
te-morau</span></h1>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">こんにちは.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Today we are going to talk about
something that arises quite frequently and in a variety of
different ways in Japanese and causes quite a lot of confusion
because of the rather strange way it's taught in conventional
Eihongo / English-language Japanese grammar.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And this is the word "morau", which
is used in all kinds of different contexts and can be very
confusing and difficult for learners to grasp what's actually going
on in these sentences.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Now, part of the reason this is so
confusing is that "morau"is customarily grouped together with "くれる"
and "あげる" as if the three belonged together and worked in the same
kind of way.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And up to a point this is
true.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">But dealing with them in this way is
actually more confusing than it is helpful.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Quite a while ago I dealt with "くれる"
and "あげる" and at the time I quite specifically didn't include
"morau" because I believe teaching them together in the way that is
common causes a great deal of unnecessary confusion.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">I'm going to just run quickly over
"くれる" and "あげる"now, and we'll talk about the ways in which they are
similar to "morau", the much more important ways in which they
aren't similar to "morau", and what we should really be comparing
"morau" to, which will make it much easier to understand a whole
range of Japanese expressions and sentences.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So, as we know, "あげる" and "くれる"mean
respectively "give up" to someone else or someone else "giving
down" to oneself or to one's in-group or someone one identifies
with.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">It can refer to giving an actual
object, a present or something, or it can refer to giving an
action, doing an action for the benefit of another person or
another person doing an action for one's own benefit.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And before we move on from there, I
just want to make a little point that people sometimes
misunderstand and that is that while giving up and giving down are
originally honorific, regarding the other person as higher than
oneself, as it were, this origin is so old that it's almost
lost.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So, in a way, despite its honorific
origin, we could regard it in a more neutral way, rather like
uploading and downloading, downloading meaning towards oneself,
uploading being towards someone else.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And the reason for that is that
"あげる" is not in fact honorific and it's generally considered rude
if you use it to a superior when you're talking about an action,
because "してあげる" means "doing for the benefit of (someone else)",
doing someone a favor, essentially.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So if you talk to a superior in such
a way as to imply that you're doing them a favor, this is going to
cause offence, so we should not regard "あげる" and "くれる" as being
actually honorific or humble.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">They're not keigo.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"くれる"can imply gratitude but it
doesn't imply humility.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And "あげる"doesn't imply honoring the
person to whom it's applied.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">All right.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So now let's move on to
"morau".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Its similarity to the others is
simply that it does represent "downloading".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And while "くれる" is, as it were, a
"push"download -- someone else taking the initiative to download to
you, "morau"is more like a "pull"download.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And that really is about where the
similarities end, because "morau" works in many ways very
differently from "くれる" and "あげる" and much closer to something else,
which we'll come to in a moment.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">When you use "morau' with a noun --
"receiving something"-- it doesn't necessarily imply a particular
giver at all.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">If we say "ichiman en を moratta",
we're saying "I got ten thousand yen".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">The implication is it came from
somewhere, it was given perhaps by someone, or at least it came
very easily.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">But we're not saying anything about
who gave it to us or where it came from or how it all came about,
unlike "くれる" and "あげる", which are bound to a particular giver and
receiver.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Now, when we're using it with a
verb, "morau"contrasts strongly with "くれる" in that "くれる" implies
that the giver took the initiative, whereas "morau", because the
emphasis is on the receiver, implies that the receiver took the
initiative.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">It's sometimes translated as "I got
(someone) to do (something)", and that isn't a bad translation in
some cases.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">It can also refer to getting a
service, which of course you take the initiative, you pay for it,
that kind of thing.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And I'll come to that in just a
moment.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Let's notice that if no giver is
mentioned, then no giver is necessarily implied.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">When a giver is mentioned, the giver
is marked by に.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Now, this is exactly the same as the
receptive helper verb "-れる/られる" because "morau", like "-れる/られる"
(the receptive, the so-called passive form, which is not passive at
all), both of them are in fact about receiving, aren't they? So
they're what we might call pull-sentences rather than
push-sentences.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">In a push-sentence, the に marks the
indirect object, the ultimate receiver of the action.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So, if we say "メアリーに ボール を 投げた",
we're saying "I threw the ball at Mary".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">The ball is the direct object (what
I threw).</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Mary is the indirect object (the
ultimate receiver of the action).</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">In a pull-sentence, where the
receiver is the が marked actor, then the ni-marked person is the
ultimate giver, the ultimate source of the action.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So it's actually much more useful to
compare "morau" to "-れる/られる", the receptive helper, because it does
almost exactly the same thing.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">It takes a verb, adds another,
helper verb to it which tells us that the action is being received
and the actor of the sentence is doing the action of receiving the
action from somebody else.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And this similarity, this likeness,
between "morau" and "-れる/られる" is not pointed out by conventional
Japanese grammar, although it's really by far the best way of
understanding it, because of course they confuse the whole issue by
calling the receptive "-れる/られる" helper passive.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">It's not passive, it's receptive,
just like "morau".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And they work very
similarly.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">The difference between them is that
"-れる/られる" implies that the action just happened to us.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">We may or may not have wanted it,
but it wasn't really our doing.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Morau"implies that we took the
action, that we actively brought the action upon ourself from
somebody else; we got them to do it for us.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So let's talk about receiving a
service.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">A very, very common expression is
"oisha-sanに mite morau" which is translated in dictionaries and
English grammars as "see a doctor".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And this is a terrible, terrible,
terrible, irresponsible translation.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">I don't know why they do this
exactly.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">I think it's because they feel that
the likeness to a common English expression makes it
easier.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">It doesn't make it easier, it makes
it much harder, because it confuses your entire perception of
what's going on here.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Oisha-sanに mite morau"doesn't mean
"I will see a doctor"; it means "I will have a doctor see me / I
will get examined by a doctor".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Now, we can see this much more
clearly if we're talking about hairdressing or a
haircut.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Sanpatsu" means " hairdressing"or "
haircut".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And if we say "sanpatsu を してmorau",
we're saying " have someone cut my hair".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Oisha-sanに mite morau" -- " have a
doctor look at me / examine me".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So you see the two work in exactly
the same way.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And we can also see that while with
"oisha-san" we're specifying a giver, with "sanpatsu を してmorau" --
"get one's hair cut"-- we're not specifying a particular
actor.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Someone might say "Sanpatsu を
してmoratta houが ii" -- "you should get your hair cut"-- but it's not
saying anything about by whom.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">It's not saying whether they want
you to go to the hairdresser or whether you get your big sister to
do it, it doesn't matter.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Just "get someone to cut your
hair".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And this leads to another very
important point, which is that the actor of "morau", the person
"morau"-ing, does not have to be the speaker.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And by comparing it to "くれる" a lot
of people get very confused by this and they get extremely muddled
when they see someone referring to someone else other than
themselves "morau"-ing.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">But there's no rule against this at
all.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">You can't use "くれる"for someone who
isn't either yourself or a member of your in-group or, for example
in a novel, it could be a character because the writer is allowed
to be inside the head of the character.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So "くれる" is tied to a person or an
in-group, but "morau"is not.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">We can freely talk about other
people "morau"-ing, receiving something.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Now, another important area that
confuses people terribly, but we're ready to deal with this now, is
"sasete morau", which is a combination of the causative helper verb
with "morau", and we now know enough about the logic of "morau" to
deal with this, but we're going to need to learn a little bit more
about the logic of the causative helper verb "-せる/させる".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So, rather than make this lesson
very complex, I'm going to deal with that in the next
lesson.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So, please be here for
that.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">If you have any questions or
comments, please put them in the Comments below and I will answer
as usual.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">I'd like to thank my Gold Kokeshi
patrons, my producer-angels, who make these videos possible, and
all my patrons and supporters on Patreon and everywhere.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And I'd like to thank you for

<h1 class="c15" id="h.vpizzitjyveg"><span class="c18">Lesson 50: 2
Aspects of Japanese that Foreigners Can't Fathom させてもらう Last Secret
of the Potential</span></h1>
<p class="c0"><span>こんにちは</span><span class="c1">.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Today we're going to talk about a
whole range of expressions in Japanese that cause a lot of
difficulty and confusion to foreign learners.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Last week we talked about the use of
"morau" with the て-form, so "naninaniて morau", which also causes a
lot of confusion and seems very unintuitive to the foreign speaker
of Japanese though once we understand how it's really structured,
it's actually highly intuitive.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So, building on that, we then find a
lot of expressions which combine the て-form plus "morau" with the
causative helper verb "-せる/させる", so we get "sasete
morau".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And this is really a bridge too far
for a lot of foreign learners because it seems very
convoluted.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">But once we've understood how
"morau" works with the て-form, it's really all quite logical except
for the fact that we also have to assimilate an important fact
about the causative helper "-せる/させる".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Now, I've done a whole lesson on
this and we've talked about most of the aspects of it which cause
trouble to foreigners.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">However, there's one part that I
didn't go into because it wasn't really relevant at that time, so
we're going to look at that now.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">As I said at the time, the causative
helper verb is, for a change, very well named in English-language
Japanese grammar because that's exactly what it is -- it's the
causative form.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So when we attach it to another verb
what we're saying is "cause someone to do that verb".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Now, one thing that confuses English
speakers is that it can mean either "allow someone to do it"or
"make or compel someone to do it", and the causative verb in itself
doesn't draw the distinction between those two.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">That confuses English speakers
because English does draw the distinction.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">We say "make someone do something"or
"let someone do something"; we don't say "cause someone to do
something".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">The thing we now have to understand
is that the Japanese causative can mean "make", it can mean
"allow", but it doesn't have to mean either.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">It means exactly what it says on the
packet.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">It means "cause -- by any means",
doesn't specify what means we're using to cause someone to do
something.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And this confuses English speakers
because they don't have a way of saying this.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">You can't really say "cause someone
to do something", at least not in modern English.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And actually English sometimes feels
the loss of this and has to make up for it by cheating with what it
has.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So, an example of that is when we
say "would you let me know tomorrow?"or "I'll let you know
tomorrow".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">We don't actually mean "let you
know"or "let me know".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">We mean "cause me to
know".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">We don't mean "allow me to know"; we
don't mean "force me to know".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">We mean "cause me to
know".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">But because we don't have this
"cause someone to do something"expression in modern English, we
actually have to cheat and say "let me know", which isn't what we
really mean.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">In Japanese, of course, we use the
causative for this.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So, "shいる" is "know" and
"shiraseru"is "cause someone to know".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So this is essentially doing what
English "let me know"is doing, without having to bend the grammar
to do it the way English does.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And this causative can be used in
many other ways that don't mean either "make"or "allow".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So "k 行く", for example, is " hear";
so "kikaseru" means "cause to hear".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And we might say "あとde kikaseyou",
which means "I'll tell you tomorrow / tomorrow I'll cause you to
hear / tomorrow I'll give you all the information".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And we can lego this together with
other words, so we can have something like "yomikikaseru", which
means "read and cause to hear".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And this is what we say if we're
reading someone a story, reading a letter to someone, or something
like that: "yomikikaseru." and once we understand this way in which
the causative helper works, we can see how it gets て-formed to have
"morau" attached to it.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">For example, we might say "kikasete
moraeます ka", which means "Can you tell me?""Kikasete" -- "cause me
to hear" ; "moraeru", which is the potential form of "morau", in
other words "possible to receive".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Is it possible to receive you
causing me to hear?" which in English, we'd probably say "Can you
tell me?"So, this "kikasete moraeます ka"might seem very confusing to
a foreign speaker because it isn't how we put it in English, but,
as you can see, structurally it's very straightforward.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">It's built out of elements that we
already know and understand and it makes perfect sense.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">We could take the sentence "学生 demo
geshuku sasete moraeません ka".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And this would tend to get
translated as meaning "Do you take in students?" but literally what
it's saying is "Even if one is a student ..." -- "学生 demo" --
"...is it not possible to receive being caused to lodge here?"
that's the structure of this, so when you see this "学生 demo geshuku
sasete moraeません ka" and you get told that it means "Do you take in
students?", you can look at it backwards, forwards and upside down
and wonder how those words come to mean that.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And of course they don't really come
to mean that at all.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">That's just what we would say in
English.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">In Japanese we're saying "Even if
one is a student, is it not possible to receive being caused to
lodge here?" and it doesn't necessarily have to be oneself that's
being caused to do something in these sentences.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">For example, if we say "megane を
awasete moratta", this gets translated as "I was fitted for
glasses", but what it literally means is "to receive the glasses
being caused to fit".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So it's the glasses that are being
caused.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">They're the ones that are being
"させる"-ed, but I am the one receiving their being caused to
fit.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So it doesn't have to be me
personally receiving being caused.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">I could be receiving something else
being caused as well.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So, we have to look at the sentence
and see what it means and, of course, apply the rules we talked
about in the lesson about busting ambiguity -- we look at what's
most probable, knowing that if something improbable is being said
the speaker will have to make that clear, just as they do in
English.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Now, sometimes of course it can
actually mean "allow", so for example if we say "kaerasete
moraiます", what we're really literally saying is "I will receive
your allowing me to go home".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">That's the literal
meaning.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">It's rather like saying in English
"with your permission, I'll leave now", which could very well mean
"I'll leave now, with or without your permission", but it puts a
veneer of politeness over the matter.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And whether it's genuinely polite or
whether it's just informing someone that you're going with a thin
veneer of politeness, this is something you'll obviously grasp from
context and tone of voice etc., just as you would in
English.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">There's a considerable difference
between saying "with your permission I'll go home now'' [softly]
and saying "with your permission I'll go home now'' [harshly] --
and that's just the same in Japanese as in English.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So, as you see, there are many ways
in which these elements can be combined, but if we understand each
of them and we understand how they fit together, we have the tools
necessary to assimilate from immersion how these things are
used.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Remember, structure doesn't teach us
how to understand Japanese.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">It gives us the basic tools we need
in order to pick it up from the only place you can really learn how
a language works -- and that is direct immersion.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And I'll just add before we
go...</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">I'm not teaching keigo at this
point.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Keigo is hyper-polite Japanese,
which is almost a little sub-language of its own.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">It's not that difficult, but it will
take a few lessons to go into it.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">But I want to mention here that
there is a keigo word for "morau".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And that is "itadaku".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Because it's hyper-polite, it's
usually used in ます-form, so it's usually "itadakiます".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And undoubtedly you'll be familiar
with that as being the thing people say before they eat:
"Itadakiます!" but what it literally means is something like "I
humbly receive".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">It obviously means "I receive",
because "itadaku" means "morau", but it is a form of keigo called
"kenjougo"or " humble language", so you're saying "I humbly
receive".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And I'm mentioning this at this
point because you will probably see some of these "sasete
morau"-type forms used with "itadaku": "sasete
itadakiます"etc.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And this piece of keigo can get used
a little more often than regular keigo because it adds politeness
to the concept of "morau".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So sometimes if there seems to be a
danger of being a bit demanding or grabby by saying what you're
going to receive or what you want to receive, you might use
"itadaku" to take the edge off that and show that you're actually
being humble and polite.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So if you see "itadaku /
itadakiます"used in any of these places, it means exactly the same
thing as "morau".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">It's just putting a more polite edge
on it.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So you needn't be confused by that
when you see it.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">If you have any questions or
comments, please put them in the Comments below and I will answer
as usual.</span></p>

<h1 class="c15" id="h.d73u3x7hnl4s"><span class="c18">Lesson 51:
Hands-on Japanese: How to read a Japanese Kaidan (ghost
story)</span></h1>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">こんにちは.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Today we're going to flex our
muscles by tackling some real live Japanese.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And I'm happy to announce that we're
partnering here with another YouTube channel called *Akasic
Tails*.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And they specialize in narrative,
and I really like their work, so I'm very happy that we're able to
work together with this Japanese channel to bring you some real
Japanese material that we can break down and apply the principles
that we've learned up to now to real situations.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So what we're going to listen to
today is a "kaidan"-- a scary story -- and it'll take us a couple
of lessons to get through it because I want to break down every
sentence and look at the various problems as we come to them to put
you in a position to be able to do this sort of thing for yourself
when you're really listening to real Japanese material.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Right.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So let's start by hearing the
portion of the story that we're going to listen to today, and then
we'll tackle it bit by bit.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">All right.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So, the first word here is "それは ",
and it's rather like saying in English "It was".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And we often begin a story,
especially a ghost story, with this kind of expression, don't we?
"It was a dark and stormy night..."So, you might start by asking,
"why is this 'それは ', which means 'that is' or 'that was' rather
than 'it was'?" well, it's a very simple reason.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">There is no visible word for "it"in
Japanese.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">The function of what is "it"in
English is always in Japanese performed by the zero
pronoun.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And it's very important to
understand this because it's one of the fundamental keys to
understanding Japanese.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">We do have pronouns in Japanese for
"me" and "you" and "they" and "she" and " he", and the zero pronoun
is used in the places these would be used in English more often
than not, but there is no word at all in Japanese for the simple
neutral pronoun "it".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So, in the cases like this where we
actually want to make a topic of what would be "it"in English, we
use the slightly more definite pronoun "that".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So we say "that was".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Here we're saying "it
was".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Now, we don't know at this stage
that it's "it was", and in fact we never learn that
directly.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Now, if you want to make sense of
this sentence, we can run through it piece by piece and if we're
listening to it without having the words in front of us, we have to
do that.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And it's not that difficult to
do.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">But I'm going to use a shortcut here
because when you have the text in front of you you can do
that.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">I don't think we should work
backward the way Rubin-先生 suggests, even though I'm a great fan of
Rubin-先生 in some ways.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">But what we can do is take a glimpse
at the end because it's going to tell us where this whole rather
complicated-looking sentence is actually going.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So, the end of the sentence -- and
we know that the engine of a sentence always comes at the end and
then it may be followed by a couple of sentence-ender particles,
but the engine comes at the end apart from that.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And what comes at the end of this
sentence is " hi" -- "day".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Now, when we see a noun ending a
sentence like this, we know that this is going to be an "a is
B"sentence and that the copula "だ" or "です", which belongs there to
turn it into a sentence, has been dropped.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Now, this happens relatively often
in casual speech.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And this is casual speech -- "casual
speech"is a bit of a catch-all term, but this is the kind of
language we'll be using perhaps in a sleepover or something where
we're telling "kaidan", where we're telling creepy tales to each
other.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And so we're using that level of
language where sometimes the copula will get dropped.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And we'll see a few other things
being dropped in the course of this story.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So, we have the structure of the
sentence here.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"それは "sets the topic, and that's
also going to be the subject, so it's "それは zeroが".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And then " hi", that's
all.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"It was...</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">day." and we don't even know that it
"was", because we need the copula on the end to give us the
tense.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So if the copula was "だ" , it would
end "だった"; if it were "です", it would end "でした".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">As it is, we have no tense
marker.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">But because we know this is setting
the scene for a story, we can tell from that fact that this is an
"It was"-type statement, a scene-setting statement.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So what about the rest of this
sentence? "aru 女の子が senpai の apaatoで okonawareta nomi買いに sanka
shita."Now, as you see, between the "それは "and the " hi"comes a
complete logical sentence in itself.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And we can see that each clause in
this logical sentence, just as we've seen in our videos on word
order and sentence structure, works by successively modifying each
element.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So, "aru 女の子が senpai の apaatoで
okonawareta nomi買いに sanka shita."*** It's modification mania! ***
So this sentence, again, we can break down into its A-car, which is
obviously "女の子が", and its engine, which is "shita" --
"did".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And then "sanka shita" -- "'sanka'
did'' -- "took part".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And then all the rest of this
sentence is successively modifying elements which modify "sanka
shita": "senpai の apaatoで okonawareta nomikai".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So, "nomikai"is "a drinking party /
a drinking meeting".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Nomi"is the い-stem, the noun form
of "nomu"- to drink - which is put together with "買い" - a meeting
or party - to give us "drinking party".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And then everything before that
modifies "drinking party".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Senpai の apaatoで okonawareta
nomikai" -- "a drinking party held in senpai's
apartment".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So we have "aru 女の子が" -- "a certain
girl" -- "senpai の apaatoで okonawareta nomi買いに"-- and this gives us
the place where she went to take part.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">It was a drinking party held in
senpai's apartment.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So we have that whole logical
clause: "a certain girl -- took part in -- a drinking party -- held
at -- senpai's apartment" and all of that is a modifier for
"day".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So, "それは ..." -- "It was a day when
a certain girl attended a drinking party held in senpai's
apartment."So you see this isn't constructed the way we generally
expect English to be constructed, but that's fine because we have
some experience now about how Japanese is constructed.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And I think you'll agree this all
makes good sense.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So that is setting the
scene.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">It's telling us the day when this
happened and it's filling in details about that day which are going
to be relevant as we move into the story.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Well, that took rather longer than I
expected for a single sentence, but I think it's worth going into
it in detail, don't you? So I'm afraid we'll have to leave this on
a bit of a shorter cliffhanger than I had originally anticipated,
but the next few sentences I think will contain less questions, so
we should be able to proceed through the text a little bit more
quickly next time.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">I would also like to apologize for
the fact that I looked half-asleep quite a lot of the time in this
video.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">I wasn't half-asleep.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">In fact, I don't go
half-asleep.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">When I'm on my charging bed I'm
completely inactive, and so long as I've got charge I'm 100%
functional -- more or less.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">What happened was that I was looking
at the text rather than the camera rather too much of the
time.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">If you have any questions or
comments, please put those in the Comments below and I will answer
as usual.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">I'd like to thank my Gold Kokeshi

<h1 class="c15" id="h.xc15h4mpurys"><span class="c18">Lesson 52: In
DEPTH Japanese Sentence Analysis in Real Native Context</span></h1>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">こんにちは.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Today we're going to get our hands
dirty by digging into some real-life Japanese by courtesy of our
Japanese partner channel, Akasic Tails.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And we're going to look at some of
the real Japanese structures that we'll encounter in real life and
we'll learn how to analyze them, and once we've got that clear in
our heads we'll be able to understand them on the fly.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Last week we looked at a Japanese
"kaidan"– a scary story – and there was so much important material
to analyze in the first sentence that we didn't get beyond the
first sentence.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So, this week I think we can
progress a little further and a little faster into the
story.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So, I'm going to play you the
portion I want to analyze today and then we'll start
analyzing.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Of course, we'll start from the
second sentence because we've analyzed the first one rather
thoroughly already.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So, the next part is "nomikaiが
shuuryou shita あと" and this is a time statement.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">It's setting the time of the action
we're now going to describe.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Now, strictly speaking, we should
say "あとに"rather than simply "あと", but again we can drop that
because we're talking relatively informally.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So having set the time, we then say
what happened: "kanojoは apaato を dete shibaraku aruita".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So, she left the apartment and
walked for a while.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So then we have "futo senpai の ieに
けいたい denwa を wasurete kita ことに kidzuita".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Futo"-- suddenly -- "senpai の
ieに"-- in senpai's house -- "けいたい denwa"-- portable telephone -- "を
wasurete kita ことに kidzuita"-- wasurete kita is wasureru, forget,
joined to "kuru".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">" wasurete kuru"is literally
"forgetting-coming"-- or what it means is really "leaving behind":
"wasurete kita", coming while having forgotten her portable
telephone in senpai's apartment.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"ことに kidzuita"-- she realized that
that's what she'd done.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"こと" makes a noun, or bundles
everything before it into that noun.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So forgetting her phone in senpai's
apartment was the "こと" that she now realized.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So why is it "ことに kidzuku" and not
"こと を kidzuku"? The English-language Japanese dictionaries and
textbooks will tell you that "kidzuku"is a verb that means the same
as English "realize".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And in practice it means much the
same, but structurally it's different.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">It's made up of an amalgam of two
words that we already know well.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">One is "ki" which means "spirit"or
"mind"or "feelings" and the other is "tsuku" which means "stick"or
"adhere".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So what this literally means is
"spirit stick" and what we're doing is sticking our spirit to
something, that is, our attention, our mind, our feelings become
adhered to a particular thing.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And in English we express that
differently by saying that we "realize"-- make real -- a
fact.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">In Japanese, our spirit adheres to a
fact.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">In Japanese, a very common
expression is "ki を tsukete ください" , which is translated as "take
care", but what it literally means is "stick your
spirit".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Stick it to what? Well, stick it to
your surroundings, stick it to what you're doing.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">In other words, pay
attention.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Now, the translation "take care"is
actually better culturally than "pay attention", because "pay
attention"sounds like an order, doesn't it? And that's not the
atmosphere of saying "ki を tsukute".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">In practice, culturally it means
something more like "take care", so the translation isn't wrong but
the structure isn't the same.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So now we get an idea why we say
"ことに kidzuku"rather than "こと を kidzuku".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">If we stick a poster to a wall, the
wall, the thing it's stuck to, is not the direct object, is it? The
direct object is the poster; the wall is the ultimate target of
that action.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And ultimate targets, in Japanese,
are always marked by に.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">As we know, the indirect object, the
ultimate target, is marked by に.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Now, even if we take the human actor
out of this and just say "the poster sticks to the wall", we're
still saying "to the wall", aren't we? We're not saying "the poster
sticks the wall", which is what we would say if the wall were the
direct object.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">We're saying "the poster sticks to
the wall".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">The wall is the target of the
poster's sticking.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So by the same token, if we stick
our spirit to something or if our spirit sticks to something, the
something to which it sticks is the target, not the direct object
of that sticking.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Now, this is important to know,
because it's another small example of the way that "Eihongo"--
so-called English-language Japanese grammar, the stuff you find in
the textbooks and the websites everywhere -- it's another way in
which it simply messes up our understanding of the logic and
structure of a very, very logical language.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Because what they'll tell you is
"'kidzuku' is a verb that means 'realize', but it takes
に".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Now, leaving aside the fact that no
verb can take に or any other logical particle (only a noun can ever
take a logical particle), we know what they mean.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">They mean that this word, that means
"realize", which in English treats the thing realized as the direct
object, actually treats the thing realized as a target and
therefore marks it with に and "this is one of those weird quirks of
Japanese that you have to learn in every individual case because
it's so random and irrational".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">It's not random and irrational at
all.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">While "kidzuku"is broadly equivalent
to "realize"in English, it's not the same structure.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">We're not real-izing, making
something real, we are sticking our spirit to something and that
something is a target and therefore it's marked by に, just as
targets are always marked by に.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Japanese doesn't go in for random
irrationalities.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">You need to go to European languages
if you want that.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And if I can just pop in a little
footnote here.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">This talk of verbs taking particles
is hugely, hugely misleading.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">It's not just a quibble to say that
logical particles can only ever belong to nouns, never to
verbs.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">I said I knew what they were talking
about when they spoke of verbs taking particles, but what they're
talking about is horribly wrong on every occasion.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">It's based on the fallacy that
logical particles can perform different functions in relation to
different verbs.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And they never, ever can.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">The only reason for ever thinking so
is, as in this case, misunderstanding what the verb is actually
doing, usually because they assume that it works exactly like its
nearest English equivalent, which is very often not the
case.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And as we've seen in the case of the
potential helper verb and adjectives of subjectivity, this fallacy
covers a huge area of Japanese and makes a very large contribution
to the inability of many students to understand
Japanese.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Because it seems so illogical and
random when in fact it's completely logical.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">That's why we call them "logical
particles".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">They never change their function
regardless of what adjective or verb is involved in the
sentence.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">They always, always do the same
thing.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And if you're at all confused about
what I'm saying here, please see the ninth lesson in this
course.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And I'll put a card up for that
right now.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Kanojoは apaatoに hikikaeshi senpai の
he や に modotte yobirin を osu."So she returned to senpai's
apartment.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">" hikikaeshi", that means "return",
and as we've seen before, the い-stem of a verb -- the verb is "
hikikaesu", which is "return"-- and particularly in narrative we
can use the い-stem of a verb in much the same way as we use the
て-form of a verb to make it the first clause of a compound
sentence.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So, she returned to senpai's
apartment -- "senpai の he や に modotte yobirin を osu".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">She returned to senpai's room and
pushed the bell.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Yobirin": "yobu"is "call", "rin"is
the on-reading of "suzu", "a small bell", so "yobirin"is a
"call-bell / a bell for calling".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Osu": she presses the
bell.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And as we've seen before, in
Japanese narrative it is allowable to use presentてnse sentences
within a pastてnse narrative to add immediacy.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And the sense here is that we've
come to a point here, to a point almost like a landing on the
stairs where we rest for a moment and make this our
present.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">She pressed the bell.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">" ところが hannouが ない" "ところ ga"is an
expression that we'll often find in narrative, again.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Ga": This "ga"is obviously not the
particle が.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">It's the other "ga", which is a
contrastive conjunction and essentially means "but".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Why do we add "ところ" to it? Well, as
we discussed in a previous lesson, "ところ", which means "place", can
also mean a place in time.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">It's almost like a resting place in
time.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">It gives us a temporary "now", as it
were.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So when we say "ところ ga", we're
saying "at that point / at that time, but".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So we're using this as a narrative
conjunction to mark the fact that something is happening that's
contrary to our expectations or wishes.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So, "ところが hannouが ない".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So although she pressed the bell,
there was, unexpectedly or contrary to our hopes, our wishes, there
was no answer.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And when she turned the
doorknob...</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"まわす" as we know, "まわる" is to "go
around", "まわす"is the other-move version of "まわる", so it's to "cause
to go around".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">When she caused the doorknob to
turn, when she turned the doorknob, "kagiは kakatte iなかった." the lock
existed in a state of not being locked, of not being hooked or hung
or fixed.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">A slightly confusing-seeming
expression because it comes from the fact that Japanese people
often lump together the concept of a key and the concept of a lock
into one.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Strictly speaking, this could be
called incorrect.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Really we're saying "joumae が
kakatta"-- the lock was fixed or hooked, but it's common in
Japanese to say the key was fixed or hooked ("kagiが kakatta") and
it would seem even a little unnatural to say it
correctly.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And because the door was unlocked,
"kanojoは その mama nakaに haitte itta"-- she went in.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"その mama" we discussed in another
video and, as we know, a "mama"is an unchanged
condition.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"その mama" means "in that unchanged
condition / just as it is".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And we can see here how that concept
is being extended a little in a way that we'll find
often.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So, for example, if we're talking
about edamame, and we say "その mama 食べる", we mean "eat them just as
it is, eat them without changing their condition, eat them without
doing anything further to prepare for eating them" and this is what
"その mama" means here.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Because the door was unlocked, she
went in just like that, just in her present condition.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">She didn't press the bell again, she
didn't wait to be invited, but "その mama"-- in the unchanged
condition of that moment -- she went in.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And in the next lesson in this
series we'll find out what happened when she did go in.</span></p>

<h1 class="c15" id="h.2li184jpvndi"><span class="c18">Lesson 53:
Enjoy Japanese Horror in Japanese</span></h1>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">こんにちは.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Today we're going to encounter a lot
of the structural points in Japanese that we've covered in this
course of lessons in action, in real situations.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And we're going to do that by
continuing with the "kaidan", the Japanese story, that we've been
reading over the last few lessons by courtesy of our Japanese
partner channel, Akasic Tails.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And we're going to be covering such
a lot of points this time that I'll put up cards for some of the
main ones but I've also made a supporting page on Kawajapa where
you can go and look up any of these points and follow them up if
you need to do so.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And I think it would be a very good
idea to follow up anything that you're not absolutely clear about
after we go through this story.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Now, to remind you where we got to
at the end of last week's lesson, our heroine had gone to a
drinking party at her senpai's apartment.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">After she left the party and was
walking home at night, she became aware that she'd left her "けいたい
denwa", her portable telephone, in senpai's apartment.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So she went back, pressed the bell,
but there was no answer, turned the handle of the door and found
that it wasn't locked.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So she walked right in.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So, let's see what happened
next.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">" he や の 中は denkiが tsuite
orazu."Now, so long as we understand that "denki を tsukeru" means
"turn on the lights" (literally it means "turn on the electricity",
but it in fact refers to the lights), the only problem with this
clause is "orazu".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">What does that mean? Well, "oru"
means the same as "いる", which is to "be".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Generally we're told that it means
to "be"of animate beings, like animals and people.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">It's not quite as simple as that and
I've explained that in another lesson, which I'll link.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Oru"is a rather older form of "いる",
but we encounter it in a variety of circumstances.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">For example, it is used in keigo as
a humble form, "kenjougo"form, of "いる" which we use to humble our
own actions and possessions, but it's also used in dialect, in
Kansai-ben for example, and it's used in literary contexts to give
a literary narrative feel.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And that's how it's being used
here.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So, "oru" means "いる", but what does
"orazu"mean? Well, you also have to understand that "-zu"is also a
piece of older Japanese which gives a literary feeling to a
narrative and it's simply a negative helper like "ない".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So why is it "orazu"? Well, that's
because while "いる", as we know, is an ichidan verb, "oru", as it
happens,is a godan verb.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So, as with all godan verbs, the
negative helper is attached to the a-stem.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So that's what's happening
here.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Orazu" means the same as
"inai".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So, "denkiが tsuite orazu" means "the
electricity existed in a state of not having been switched on"or,
in plain English, the lights were off.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Makkura de": "makkura"is
"pitchだrk", literally "true dark / complete dark".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Kura", of course, we know as "暗い",
the adjective "dark", and we know that when we see an adjective
without its -i on the end, if it makes a word at all, it will be a
noun.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">We also know that if we see a word
that is all kanji, it's almost certainly going to be a
noun.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So "makkura"is "pitch
darkness".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Makkura de"-- the "で" here is the
て-form of "だ" or "です".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So, " he や の 中は denkiが tsuite orazu
makkura de" -- "as for the inside of the room, the lights were off,
it was pitch dark".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Dou や ra senpaiは mou nete shimatta
らしい.""Dou や ra": in this case means "it seems, it appears to be the
case" and this is actually working in tandem with the "-らしい" at the
end, which also means "seems like, appears to be".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And we've covered this in a previous
lesson as well.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So in between this sandwich that
gives us the "it appears to be the case"meaning, it says "senpaiは
mou nete shimatta" -- "senpai has already done gone to sleep / done
gone to bed".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">As we know, that "shimau,
shimatta"gives that "done"meaning.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And that's really the best way to
put it in English.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">It sounds a bit rustic in English,
but there's nothing else in English which I think gives that sense
of "shimau, shimatta, chatta"quite as well as "done".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">She'd already done gone to bed, it
seemed.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">" buyoujin だ na": "buyoujin" means
literally "not using one's heart", but " heart" here means mind or
spirit.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Youjin"is "care"or "cautiousness" ;
"buyoujin"is "lack of care"or "lack of cautiousness".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">But this particular word "buyoujin"
tends to mean lack of cautiousness in relation to criminal or other
hostile activity.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So we might say that walking alone
in a dangerous place is "buyoujin"or leaving valuables on display
in our car is "buyoujin".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And here, leaving her door unlocked
at night so anybody could just walk in is "buyoujin".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">" buyoujin だ na": "na", as we know,
is the particle used for directing a comment at ourself, so she's
thinking to herself "buyoujin だ" -- it's reckless, dangerous
behavior.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">" buyoujin だ na, to omotta kanojoは
": so, she, who was thinking this, "denki を tsukete senpai を okosou
ka to omotta ga".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">All right, so this looks a little
bit complicated and we still haven't finished the sentence, but
let's just take it bit by bit.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">First of all she thought "buyoujin"
-- "unsafe, dangerous behavior" ; "she thought" -- "to omotta
kanojo"-- she who thought that, then thought something else; "denki
を tsukete" -- "tsukeru", of course, is the other-move version of
"tsuku", so she thought of switching on the lights; "senpai を
okosou"-- now, as we know, that "そう"ending is a volitional ending;
"okosou ka"-- she thought about taking the action of awakening
senpai.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Okosu"- と "wake someone up" ;
"okいる", you wake up yourself; "okosu"-- す endings, as we know, mean
other-move verbs, so "okosu"is to wake someone else up.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Okosou ka"-- so, she's thinking
about this action.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">The "ka", as we know from another
lesson, marks a question, that's to say, a proposition.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So the proposition was taking the
action of waking up senpai.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">This is what she thought,
but...</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">("ga" -- "but") "senpaiが kanari
yotte ita no を omoidashi".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So, "kanari"is another one of those
adverbial nouns that can modify a verb or an adjective without the
に or と that's usually needed for a noun to modify a verb or an
adjective, so "kanari yotte いた" -- "you"is to "be sick or to be
drunk", in this case "drunk".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Kanari" means "sufficiently"or
"pretty much"or "very".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So she was pretty drunk, she was in
the state of being pretty drunk: "kanari yotte ita no"-- the "の"of
course bundles that statement into a noun box -- "no を omoidashi"
-- "omoidashi"is "remember", so she remembered the fact -- the
"の"-- that senpai had been pretty drunk.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Omoidasu"is "remember" ;
"omoidashi", once again, as we discussed last week, is the い-stem
of "omoidasu" -- "remember"-- and the い-stem here is being used
like the て-form to make this clause a part of a compound
sentence.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So we have a three-fold compound
sentence now.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">First of all, we use "ga" -- "but"--
as the connector for the first part, and the second part we're
using -shi like the て-form as the connector for the third part, and
the third part is "sotto してoku ことに shita".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Sotto"is another one of these
adverbial nouns, meaning "softly, gently or quietly".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Sotto する" means to "do softly,
gently or quietly".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">It's like "静かに する", which means to
"do quietly".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Sotto する" means also to "do
quietly", but "静か" means more "keep quiet".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">You might say this to a class:
"静かに!" -- "Keep quiet!""Sotto する" is more to "do (something) in a
quiet manner".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Now, "静か"can be used in that way
too, but "sotto する" means to do something quietly; it can even mean
secretly.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"静か"can't mean secretly; "sotto"can
mean secretly.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Here it doesn't mean secretly, but
it does mean doing something quietly so that someone else won't be
aware of you doing it, which is the kind of implication that
"sotto"often tends to have.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Sotto してoku" -- "してoku", as we
know, is to "put in place an action".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Oku" means to "place
(something)".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Attaching "oke" to the て-form of a
verb means putting that action in place.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And, as we know, the textbooks often
say it means "doing it in advance"or "doing it in preparation", but
actually it means "putting the action in place".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So she's essentially saying here,
"do what she has to do, put her action in place,
quietly".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Sotto してoku ことに shita": now, "ことに
する", as we've also covered in a previous lesson, means "decide to
do".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So this last bit means she decided
to put her action quietly into place, literally.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So we've got this whole sentence
here: "buyoujin だ na, to omotta kanojoは denki を tsukete senpai を
okosou ka to omottaが senpaiが kanari yotte ita no を omoidashi sotto
してoku ことに shita."So, "'That's dangerous, isn't it, leaving the door
open,' she thought; she considered switching the lights on and
awakening senpai, but she remembered that senpai had been pretty
drunk and so she decided to do what she had to do quietly.""Makkura
の naka de jibun の けいたい denwa を sagashi dasu to" -- "In the pitch
darkness -- makkura の naka de -- jibun の けいたい denwa -- her own
telephone -- sagashi dasu".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Sagashi dasu": "sagasu" as we know,
is "search" ; "sagashi dasu"is literally "search out", so she
sought it out, she found it -- "to".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">'''Wasuremono を shita no de toriに
modoriました --' to hitokoe kakete he や を atoに shita."So she said
something aloud here, but presumably quite quietly so that she
wouldn't wake senpai.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">She said: "wasuremono" -- "forgotten
thing" -- "を shita no de" -- "I did a forgotten thing / I forgot a
thing / I left a thing behind" -- "wasuremono を shita no de"--
because of that -- "toriに modoriました" -- "I came back to take it /
in order to take it, I returned" -- "to hitokoe kakete" -- "koe(を)
kakeru"is to say something to someone, to engage them in
conversation, here " hitokoe"-- she just said that single word, she
just said that single voice, literally, she just said that -- " he
や を atoに shita"-- so she just said that, presumably quietly so that
senpai wouldn't even hear her, but she felt she ought to say
something -- " he や を atoに shita" -- "あとに する"literally means to
"turn it into behind", in other words, put it behind you, in other
words, leave -- she left the room -- " he や を atoに shita"-- she
made the room the thing behind her by leaving it.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And that was that for the
evening.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Well, she got out of that all right,
didn't she? It was a bit scary, but we didn't hear what happened
the next day.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">That's what we're going to talk
about next week.</span></p>

<h1 class="c15" id="h.6e9rozs0p1ry"><span class="c18">Lesson 54:
IRREGULARITIES in Japanese and how they work |
見る、見られる、見れる、見える、聞く、聞ける、聞こえる</span></h1>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">こんにちは.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Today we're going to talk about some
exceptions in Japanese, how they work, and why they're
there.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And in doing that, I think we're
going to gain some insight into how Japanese holds together and how
we can understand it.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So what we're going to talk about
today is "見る, miられる, mireru, 見える, kiku, kikeru, 聞こえる".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Now, that seems like quite a
confusing lot of things, doesn't it? But in fact all we have there
is the basic dictionary forms of "見る" and "k 行く" -- "see" and "
hear"-- and the potential form of each and one alternative or
exceptional potential form.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Now, it looks like two in the case
of "見る", but it's actually one, and we'll come to that in just a
moment.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">I always say that Japanese is a
very, very regular and logical language, and the conventional
wisdom is that it only has two irregular verbs, "kuru" and
"する".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Now, as I've mentioned before, it
does in fact have a few other minor irregularities, and by minor
irregularities what I mean is verbs that aren't really irregular
verbs but they do become irregular in one particular area, in one
single place only.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And there aren't many of these, but
there are a few and these are two of them.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And we want to look at what they are
and, more importantly, why they are what they are and what they
mean, how we can understand them.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So to start with, we understand how
the regular potential form, the "able to do"form, of verbs work,
don't we? We form it simply by turning the verb into its e-stem and
adding the very simple potential helper verb "る", which is just one
character: る.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">That's the godan form.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And the ichidan form: in the ichidan
we do what we always do, we simply remove the る and put on whatever
it is we're going to put on.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">In this case, the ichidan potential
helper is "られる".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So, as we can see, "miられる" is the
regular potential form of "見る", which is an ichidan verb, and
"kikeru"is the regular potential form of "k 行く", which is of course
a godan verb.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So why am I saying that there's only
one variant of "見る" and not two? Well, that's because the variant
is "見える", and we'll come back to that in a moment.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Mireru"is in fact the ichidan form
being affected by a phenomenon which we call "ra nuki".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Ra nuki" means literally "taking
out the ra".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And this is something that happens
quite widely in Japanese.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">You're going to encounter it pretty
often once you're actually using Japanese, so that may be right
now.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">It simply consists of taking out the
"ra", dropping the "ra", in the ichidan potential form of
verbs.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">This is considered to be incorrect
grammar, not only by the English Japanese textbooks but also by
native Japanese grammar textbooks.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">It's considered to be incorrect
grammar, but it's very, very widespread, much more widespread than
most of the popular bits of incorrect grammar that you'll hear from
time to time.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And I would suggest that this is
probably going to be an evolution of the language.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Now, Western people often tend to
say, "well, if a number of people are using an incorrect usage then
how can you say it's incorrect? Surely it's a new correct usage,
because 'correct' is just what people use." and I think this is a
mistake and a rather dangerous and irresponsible mistake, because
while it's true that language evolves, the evolution of language is
pretty much the same as the theorized evolution of
species.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">That's to say, species evolve from
mutations.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Mutations happen relatively often
and most of them die out.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Only a few of them, and usually in
cases where they have some special advantage, actually persist and
become part of the evolution of the species.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And the same is true of
languages.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Most incorrect usages that get taken
up by largish numbers of people die out.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Only a very few of them ever become
parts of the real evolution of the language.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So if you do what is currently being
done in the West, which is put in misuses of language into
dictionaries, what you're doing is actually short-circuiting the
self-correcting function of language.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Language over a generation or so,
over maybe a couple of decades, will reject most uses that go
against its basic logic.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">A very few of them will end up
making minor changes in the basic logic.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And that's why it's a mistake to put
into dictionaries at an early stage misuses of language, because we
have no way of knowing at that early stage whether they're really
going to be genuine evolutions of language or whether they're going
to die out within a generation.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">What we do know is that in most
cases, in the vast majority of cases, they would die out within a
generation, and by putting them into a dictionary we're interfering
with that self-correcting process of language.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And this, I would say, is important,
because it's this way of thinking that makes Japanese teaching so
very poor in the West.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">It's the way of thinking that
assumes that language is a completely irrational thing that just
happens to evolve in any way it chooses to evolve.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And it's not.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Language is governed by
logic.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And Japanese is governed by logic
more than most languages.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">But if you reject that notion, if
you think that language is simply irrational and chance and
accidental and anything anybody happens to use is as correct as
anything else, then you end up teaching language as if it were just
a hodgepodge of things that you have to learn because they just
happen to be there and don't have any underlying logic.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And that really is the fallacy that
underlies modern Western Japanese teaching.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So, that's a digression.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Let's get back to
"miられる".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Miられる" is what they'll use, because
that is currently the correct usage.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So we have "見る", we have "miられる",
and "見える".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">We have "k 行く", we have "kikeru" and
we have "聞こえる".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So what is the difference between
the two potential forms, the regular and the irregular potential
form? Now, in each case here, the irregular potential form is what
I'm going to call a forced self-move form.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Now, as we know from our lesson on
the potential, potential is usually self-move -- and if you don't
know what "self-move"is, you should look at the lesson on self-move
and other-move verbs too.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">They sometimes get called, not
exactly accurately, transitive and intransitive.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So, for example, if we want to say
"I can read the book", in Japanese we actually say "the book does
readable to me".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So we say "本が 読める".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">This is self-move.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">The book is the actor and it's
acting upon itself.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">It's making itself readable, it's
"doing readable"literally.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">There's no exact English translation
for this, because we're not saying the book IS readable; it's not
an adjectival phrase.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">We're saying the book DOES
readable.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So we just have to get used to the
fact that Japanese is much more happy than English to treat states
of being as verbal actions.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So if we want to say "I can read the
book", we say "本が 読める", but if we just want to say "I can read", we
might say "読める"or "私が 読める", and again we have a self-move
verb.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">In one case we're saying "I do
readable (I am able to read)", in the other we say "the book does
readable (the book does being able to be read)" and that's how it
works.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">However, it is also possible to use
the potential in other-move contexts.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Usually this happens in modifying
clauses.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">These are sometimes called by
Western textbooks "subordinate clauses", which they are, but I
think it's better and clearer to call them "modifying clauses", and
I've done quite a lot of work on modifying clauses, so I'd
recommend this video if you want to know exactly what I
mean.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So, in modifying clauses
particularly we can use the potential as an other-move
verb.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">For example, we might say "Sakura を
miられる hi を tanoshimini している." this means "I'm looking forward to
the day when I can see Sakura." and as you see, here we're saying
"Sakura を miられる", using "miられる", the potential, "being able to see
Sakura", as an other-move verb with an object, which is
Sakura.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Now, we can do that with "miられる", we
can do that with "kikeru", but we can't do it with "見える"or
"聞こえる".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">They are forced to be used as
self-move verbs only.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And on the whole, because potential
verbs mostly are self-move in Japanese, whether we're talking about
something else or whether we're talking about ourselves, we use
them in a self-move manner, those two are the most commonly
used.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Actually we can use the other forms,
the regular forms, "miられる" and "kikeru", as self-move verbs too,
but they can also be used as other-move verbs.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">With "見える" and "miられる", there is a
difference in nuance, which is that "見える"usually means being able,
actually physically able, to see something, and "miられる"more implies
having the opportunity to see something.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So if we were to say "shibaiが
miられる", we're saying I have the opportunity to see the
play.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">If we say "shibaiが 見える", we might
mean the lady in front of me has taken off her big hat so I'm able
to see the play.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">However, this alone wouldn't be, I
think, sufficient reason for these two variants of the words
surviving into modern Japanese.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">The important reason, which is based
in the very nature of seeing and hearing and expressions we use in
connection with seeing and hearing, is this: they are both used in
places where in English we would say that something "looks
like"something or something "sounds like"something.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">You can't use the standard versions
"kikeru" and "miられる"for this.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">You have to use these
variants.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So if you say "Sakuraは kaeruに 見える",
you're saying "Sakura looks like a frog".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So when we say "looks like", we use
the targeting particle に with a noun, or with an adjective we use
the く-stem of the adjective.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So we say "kaeruに 見える" -- "looks
like a frog"-- or we can say of someone "wakaku 見える" -- "she looks
young".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And we can also use it not just for
literally how something sounds to our ears or for how something
looks to our eyes, but what its appearance is.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So we can say "kimように 聞こえる" -- "it
sounds strange / sounds peculiar".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So, we're not talking here
necessarily about the actual sound.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">It might not be a noise that sounds
strange.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">It may be something somebody said
that sounds strange.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So we're using either the adverbial
form of an adjective or the adjective-making targeting particle に
to describe how something appears to us, how something sounds to
us, literally or figuratively.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And this is the real reason for the
survival of these alternative forms of the potential.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">They have this specific meaning,
which the other form, the regular form, can't have.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And it's not a coincidence that it's
this forced, must-be self-move version that takes on that meaning,
because the way something else looks, the way something else
sounds, always has to be self-move.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">We're not talking about anything we
do to the look or anything we do to the sound, but about how it
looks and sounds in itself.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So this extremely self-move version,
which can't be used in other-move contexts, is what is used in the
case of both seeing and hearing to describe how something sounds to
us and how something looks to us.</span></p>

<h1 class="c15" id="h.xxtir8ol3jia"><span class="c18">Lesson 55:
Secrets of the で particle. Why do we say みんなで行く? and
世界で一番?</span></h1>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">こんにちは.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Today we're going to drill a bit
deeper into some areas of Japanese structure.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">I'm going to look at some aspects of
the で particle that we haven't looked at so far and, in order to do
that, we're going to have to look at some new structural concepts
that we haven't considered up to this point.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">We haven't considered them partly
because you can get quite a long way in elementary Japanese without
knowing them, but as we get into more complex areas it's a good
idea to have these tools in our tool box.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So, let's get started.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">As I've said before, almost all
Japanese words divide into three kinds, that is, nouns, verbs and
adjectives.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">There are a few words that are
outside these three but not a great number.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Most of the things that aren't verbs
and adjectives in fact turn out to be nouns.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">However, there's another way of
dividing Japanese words which is used in Japanese grammar and that
is into "taigen" and "yougen", which literally means "body words"
and "use words", but the terms I'm going to employ is "static
words"or "static elements" and "active words"or "active
elements".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Now, static or body words
essentially boil down to nouns, so in a way this underlines the
noun-centered structure of Japanese, because we divide them into
nouns and the rest, the other two.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And it's very easy to see how this
works.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">By "active words" what we mean is
those words that can transform, that can modify.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And that applies to both adjectives
and verbs.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And in fact they transform in very
much the same way.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">In both cases the thing that
transforms is always the last kana of the word.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And we know that both verbs and
adjectives must always end in a kana.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">They can't be all kanji, otherwise
they'd be nouns.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">All verbs end in an う-row kana; all
adjectives end in the kana い.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And that is the part, and the only
part, that changes.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">With godan verbs, the う-row kana
changes to its equivalent in one of the other rows.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So, す can become -sa, -shi, -se or
-so.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And ichidan verbs simply drop the る
.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Verbs can also modify into the
て-form, and again this is essentially a question of either changing
or dropping the final kana and adding て or で .</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And the same of course with
た-form.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Adjectives can change the -i to く,
-ka or -ke, so we can have "oish 行く", "oishikatta"or
"oishikereba".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Or we can drop the -i altogether and
add something else, as for example in "おいしそう".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Nouns, on the other hand, can't
modify at all.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">You can't do anything with the last
kana of a noun or any other part of a noun in terms of grammatical
modification.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">But you can add logical particles to
a noun and you can also add the copula "だ" or "です" to a
noun.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So, we have two sets of words: the
"yougen", the active words which you can modify by changing the
final kana and adding something but you can't add logical particles
or the copula to these, and nouns and also pronouns and other
noun-like entities, "taigen"or static words, which you can't modify
but you can add logical particles or the copula.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And it's important to understand
that when we add the logical particle or the copula to a noun we
regard those two things joined together as a unit.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So for example when we add the soft
copula "na" to an adjectival noun like "きれい" we have "きれい na", and
"きれい na"is regarded as a unit in itself.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And actually that unit could be
called a "な-adjective", because "きれい"plus "na"or "だ" becomes an
adjectival unit.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So although I very much object to
the term "な-adjective"in the way it's used by Western textbooks,
which is to say they will tell you that "きれい"is a "な-adjective",
and it's not -- it's a noun, it's not any kind of an adjective --
we could say that "きれい na"or "きれい だ" is a な-adjective.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">I would not recommend it, simply
because the term is so abused in Western so-called Japanese grammar
that it's best left alone.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">It has a name in Japanese but since
it would take rather a while to explain it, I won't go into that
here.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">But it's not anything like
"な-adjective".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Now, the other thing to understand
is that when we attach the copula to a noun, that combination is in
fact a "yougen"or active unit.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And that's obvious, because once
you've attached the copula to it, we can in fact modify
it.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">The copula has a て-form, which is
"で", so "きれい na"can become "きれい de"in order to conjoin it to
something else.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">We can also modify "きれい だ" into,
say, "きれい だった".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So, once we attach the copula to a
noun, we have a "yougen", an active unit, and as I'm sure you have
already worked out by now, this means that the three engines, the
three possible ways of ending a sentence, are all "yougen", or
active units.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">That's to say, verb, adjective and
noun-plus-copula.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">These are the three possible engines
of a sentence and they are also the three possible
"yougen".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">We tend to call them "yougen" when
they're modifying something else, when they're inside a
sentence.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So, armed with this information, we
can now take a deeper look at the particle で .</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">When I introduced it in the video on
logical particles, I said that it, like the other logical particles
other thanが (which, of course, is in every sentence) and の (which
is a logical particle, but it doesn't tell us what its noun is
doing in relation to the action of the sentence; it tells us about
the noun in relation to another noun) but the other particles,
including で , I said, were only active in A-does-B sentences,
that's verb-sentences.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Now, that is something of an
oversimplification.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">There is another way in which they
can act.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">It doesn't become too much of a
problem not knowing that at the beginning, but as we progress we
need to understand this.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And in order to understand it we
need to know what we've just learned.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">We need to know about "taigen" and
"yougen", static and active elements.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Because the truth is not that で is
absolutely restricted to verb-sentences, A-does-B sentences,
although most of the time it is.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">What it's restricted to is clauses
that modify "yougen".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And the "yougen", as we know, can be
a verb, but it can also be an adjective or even an adjectival
noun-plus-copula.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And there are some cases where this
happens.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So what is で actually doing? Well,
as we know, there are three positional logical particles, and they
are the targeting particle に, which tells us where something goes
to or where it is, where it stays once it's got there, there is
-he, which is the directional particle, and there is で .</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And what で really does is tells us
the boundary or limit within which something happens.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Usually that's a physical boundary,
a physical area, though it doesn't always have to be.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So, に tells where a noun (person,
animal, thing) is headed to or where it's located; -he tells us
direction in which it's going; で tells us the boundary within which
an action or a state of being takes place.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">It's usually an action, so that's
how we introduce it, but it can be a state of being.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">In other words, it can be an
adjectival.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So for example let's take the phrase
"sekaiで ichiban おいしい raamen".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Now, people will ask, "why で ? Why
are we using で in this case?" and the answer is that "sekaiで "--
and remember that we always treat a logical particle plus the noun
it's attached to as a unit -- "sekaiで "is defining the limit within
which something is happening, but in this case it's defining the
limit within which a state of being applies.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So we're talking about "the most
delicious ramen in the world".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">" the world"is the limit we're
applying.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And in this case, of course, with
"the world" we're trying to give as big a limit as
possible.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">But we might say, "kono machiで
ichiban おいしい raamen" and then we're saying "the most delicious
ramen in this town".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So we've drawn a boundary around
it.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">We're not saying it's the most
delicious ramen possible, but we are saying within certain limits,
within the limits of this town, it's the most delicious
ramen.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So that's what で is
doing.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Just as with an action it tells us
where the action takes place, the locality, the boundary within
which it takes place, with the other kind of "yougen", an
adjectival, it's telling us the boundary within which that
adjectival quality prevails.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Now, we can also say "sekai の
ichiban おいしい raamen".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">That's less commonly said, but it
could be said.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And what that means is "the most
delicious ramen of the world", but the point to understand here is
that で is drawing the boundaries of the "yougen", the active
element, the verb or in this case the adjective; の is doing
something different.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">We know what の does: it links one
noun to another.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So it's not modifying the quality of
"おいしい", as で is.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">It's modifying "raamen".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And because of this we can also say
"kono raamenは sekaiで ichiban おいしい"-- we're saying "this ramen is
the most delicious in the world." but we can't say "kono raamenは
sekai の ichiban おいしい." why can't we? Because, as we know from the
lesson on word order, in Japanese words only modify words that come
after them.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">They can't modify words that come
before them.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And because の can't modify "おいしい",
it can only modify "raamen", which is another noun, and because
"raamen"is on the wrong side of it, we can't actually use
that.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So we have to say "kono raamenは
sekaiで ichiban おいしい", because で sets the boundary within which
"おいしい"prevails.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Now, since we know that a
noun-plus-copula also functions as a "yougen", an active element,
we can also say "sekaiで ichiban yuumei na andoroido".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And in this case, "sekaiで "is
modifying "yuumei na".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">It couldn't modify "yuumei"on its
own, because "yuumei"is a noun, but it can modify "yuumei
na".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So it's telling us the boundaries
within which this fame operates.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"She's the most famous android in
the world".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">She may not be the most famous
android in the Solar System, but she is the most famous android in
the world.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Now the same happens when we say
something like "minnaで odoru" -- "we all dance".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Why do we say "minnaで "? Well, if we
say "futariで odoru", we're saying "two of us dance".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">If we say " hitoriで odoru", we're
saying "dance alone".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">The quantitative sentence plus で is
describing the limits of the people who do it.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So, as I said before, the boundary
or area or demarcation that で draws for us is usually a physical
one, a place.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">If we say " he や で odoru", we're
saying "I dance in the room." but if we say " hitoriで odoru", we're
saying "I dance alone."In both cases we're drawing a boundary to
say what are the limits.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">The physical limits are the room,
and the numerical or quantitative limits are " hitori", "futari",
"minna"etc.</span></p>

<h1 class="c15" id="h.58sz01s6wkw6"><span class="c18">Lesson 56:
"agility": The Vital Language Factor No One Mentions. Deeper
secrets of は and の particles</span></h1>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">こんにちは.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Today we're going to talk about a
topic that isn't often referred to, which is agility in
language.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And I'm not talking about my ability
or your ability in language.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">I'm talking about the agility of
language itself, the ability of languages to express certain things
in economical, swift-footed ways that other languages find more
difficult.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And this is important because when
languages have greater agility in particular forms of expression
they use them in ways that seem quite unfamiliar and strange to
people whose languages can't handle those forms of expression in
the same agile manner.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And this often leaves learners quite
puzzled as to what's going on in a lot of sentences.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So, I'm going to start off with one
of the most fundamental and structural causes of this problem, and
that is the topic-marking particle は .</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Once people get the idea that は is a
topic-marker and is always a topic-marker, they often then start to
say, "well, why are we using a topic-marker? Why are we saying 'as
for this apple' in places where it seems really not something we
would do in English or in many other languages?"Now, the reason for
this has to do of course with the fact that Japanese is what
linguists call "a topic-prominent language".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Topic-comment structure is very
fundamental to Japanese in a way that it isn't to English, and I'm
going to talk about that at greater length in a future
video.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">But currently what I want to talk
about is how this affects the matter of agility, how it makes the
formation of a topic a very lightweight, a very agile, a very
quick-footed operation, which in other languages, like English, it
isn't.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So, I'm going to reintroduce a
sentence I used in my first advanced lesson on the use of the は
particle, and that is: "afurikaは raionは いるが toraは inai."Now, as you
see, we have three は s in the space of a very short sentence and
they are indeed all topic-markers, because は always is a
topic-marker.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And I have explained what's going
on, but we're going to look at this in terms of agility.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">What's going on, of course, is that
the first は is the overall topic-marker.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">It's saying "afurika は ..." --
"Speaking of Africa..." and everything that follows is going to be
a comment on the topic of Africa.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">What follows a は-marked topic has to
be a logical clause.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">It doesn't matter how small it is,
but it must be a logical clause.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And it must contain both the
necessary elements of a logical clause just like any
other.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">What we have here in fact is a
logical sentence consisting of two logical clauses and each of them
contains what we might call a subtopic.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">That's to say, each logical clause
in itself also has a topic statement preceding it.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So if we write it out in full, it
would be "afurikaは raionは zeroが いるが toraは zeroが inai."So the two
logical clauses are "zeroが いる" and "zeroが inai", but both of them
state their own subtopics.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So, why are they doing that? Well,
we know this already.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">It's because は is used to
distinguish things.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So what we're saying here is
"Speaking of Africa, speaking of lions, they exist, but speaking of
tigers, they don't exist."Now, I think we can see how this works in
English and how it uses topic-marking to distinguish two different
states of affairs.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">But this isn't something we would
ever say in English.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Why not? Because this "speaking
of"in English is not agile at all.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">It's setting up a rather dramatic
and heavy, cumbersome way of introducing a subject.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">We can't just keep saying "speaking
of"in a sentence, because "speaking of" and the various other ways
that we introduce topics in English are not agile.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Japanese は is very, very
agile.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">We can freely throw it in wherever
we want to create a distinction like this, because は distinguishes
things.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">When we change a topic using は , we
are implicitly saying that the comment on the new topic is
different from the comment on the old topic.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">If we want to say that the comment
is the same, then we have to use the other topic-marker,
-mo.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And this sentence actually doubles
down on that by giving a は to both the compounded logical
clauses.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So we're saying "speaking of
lions..." this topic has a comment which is different from another
topic that may be nearby.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">But "speaking of lions, they exist",
and then "speaking of tigers..." this topic also has a comment that
will differ from the comment on any nearby topic: "they don't
exist".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Now, as you see, this is a very
cumbersome process if we think about it in English.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">But if we understand it in Japanese,
if we know how the は particle is used lightly and easily and
agilely in this kind of circumstance, it ceases to be a
problem.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Now, another area where we often get
confusion because of the agility of a Japanese element in
comparison to any way we would imitate it in English is the
no-particle, the so-called nominalizing -no, which acts as a
pronoun and bundles everything coming before it, everything
modifying it, into a noun-box, into a single noun-like
entity.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And one of my patrons asked me this
question, and it's a short sentence and it ought to be fairly
simple, but my patron found it quite difficult, and I think a lot
of people find this sort of thing quite difficult.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Not because it is difficult, not
because the structure is actually hard to parse, but because it's
very unlike what we would do in English or many other languages,
under the same circumstances.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So, this comes from a Disney song,
"the Bells of Notre Dame", and the first line is "asa の Pariに
hibiku-noは kane だ yo".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So, as you see, this is quite a
short and simple-looking sentence.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">But can you see where the A and the
B of this sentence are? My patron suggested that this meant "a bell
resounds in morning Paris" and that's more the sort of thing we
would be saying in English.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">But we can see that this is in fact
an A-is-B sentence and we can see also that it has a は-marked topic
and that the は-marked topic comes quite near the end.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So the A-is-B, the logical
structure, has to come after the は-marked topic.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So what's the は-marked topic? The
は-marked topic is "asa の Pariに hibiku-no".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So の is bundling the rest of it,
"in-morning-Paris-resounds-no", in other words "that which resounds
in morning Paris".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And then of course we must have a
logical が marked subject which has been defined for us by that
-no.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So, "that which resounds in morning
Paris, it is (or they are) bells, yo."So why is it being put in
this way? You might say, because it can be.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">In English, this is
difficult.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">In English, "that which resounds in
morning Paris, that's bells"doesn't sound natural at
all.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And the reason is because setting up
a topic like "that which resounds in morning Paris"is not
straightforward in English.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">It's not agile; it's cumbersome;
it's large; it's slow-footed.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">But in Japanese we do this all the
time.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">We say things like "that which she
saw when she went into the room was..."Now, in English we're much
more likely to say "when she went into the room she saw..."or "In
Paris in the morning bells resound throughout the city."If we want
to use this "that which..."kind of structure, we have to have built
up to it.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">If we, for example, have spent some
time establishing the fact that she's nervous about what she's
going to see when she opens the door and looks into the room, then
we can say "what she saw when she looked in the room was..." but we
need to have set that up.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">We need to have made some kind of
preparation to use that form, because it's not agile.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">It's not a lightweight thing that we
can just slip in anywhere.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">On the other hand, Japanese can use
this as a narrative technique, setting up anticipation of what she
saw and resolving it very quickly over the course of a short
sentence and without making any fuss about it, because it's a
light, agile verbal formula.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And because of that, you're going to
see it all over the place in Japanese, so you need to get used to
it.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">But really the important point of
this lesson is the concept of agility itself, because we're going
to come across in Japanese as we go forward various cases where
Japanese uses expression strategies which may seem very unnatural
and strange when you try to translate them into English, because
the English equivalents are not agile and the Japanese equivalents
are very agile and lightweight.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And one of the things about being
agile and lightweight is not so much that it's easy to say in
itself but that it's easy to shoehorn into the middle of saying
something else.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">In other words, it doesn't have to
be the main point of the statement.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">In English you can't say things like
"speaking of..."or "as for..."unless that's going to be the main
point of the statement.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">But in Japanese you can because it's
lighter, it's more agile.</span></p>

<h1 class="c15" id="h.8qn6qxsoxmbz"><span class="c18">Lesson 57: 込む
Komu and the secret of multi-meaning Japanese words</span></h1>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">こんにちは.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Today we're going to talk about one
word in particular that has a lot of different meanings in
different contexts and can be attached to other words.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">But, more than that, we're going to
talk about how this kind of word works and how we can understand
them.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">We often see in dictionaries words
that have a whole range of different and apparently unconnected
meanings.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">I'm not talking about homophones
here, where the kanji are different.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">They may not be related, though they
sometimes are.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">But I'm talking about words that
actually are the same word but have a range of different
meanings.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And in these cases the important
thing to understand is that normally there's going to be a base,
concrete meaning and then from that a number of metaphorical
meanings.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And this isn't just a side issue
with human language.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Human language, whenever it
discusses abstraction, uses words that are based in concrete,
physical metaphors.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And we may sometimes forget the
concrete, physical metaphors, but they're always there.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Even when we talk about time, we
have to talk about it in terms of space.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">We talk about time "going forward"or
"going backward".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">We talk about a time "line"-- a line
is an entity that exists in space.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">We can't actually discuss time
without discussing it in terms of space.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And this continues with all other
abstractions in human languages.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">The word "focus"originally means a "
hearth".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">People used to sit around the hearth
fire and that would be at the center, the focus of their
activity.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And from that physical metaphor come
all the extended and abstract meanings of the word
"focus".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">The word "stimulus"originally meant
an "ox-goad", a pointed stick that you would drive oxen along
with.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And from that come all the abstract
meanings of "stimulus".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Politics"comes from a word that
simply means "city".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Economics"comes from a word that
simply means " house".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Now, we don't need to know the
physical metaphors on which words like this are based, but when we
come across words in Japanese that seem to have different and
contradictory meanings, we do need to understand the basic metaphor
in order to grasp the other meanings without learning them as a
long laundry-list of apparently random things.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So, if we see the word "kいる" in a
dictionary -- which means "cut"-- we see lots and lots of meanings
for it like "ending a conversation", "severing a relationship",
"crossing a field".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And all of these just come from the
basic meaning of "cut".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Even in English we talk about
"cutting across a field".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Now, that's easy enough, so long as
we understand the principle, with a word like "cut", where we have
a very definite, clear-cut (if I may say so) equivalent in
English.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">But when we come to words which
don't have an exact English equivalent, it can get a bit harder
unless we understand what they mean.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And one of those words, which we're
going to see everywhere in Japanese, is the word "komu".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Now, "komu"does not have an exact
meaning in English, but we can see what it does mean by looking at
the kanji.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">The kanji is essentially the kanji
of "いる / haいる / ireru" -- "go in"or "put in"-- and that's on a
"road".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">It's a road that some people call
"the water slide".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">I always see it as a "fast road" and
that's exactly what's going on here.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">It's "putting in on a water slide /
putting in on roller skates / cramming in in large quantities /
putting in rapidly / putting in vigorously".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">That's what "komu" means.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Now, we may encounter it first of
all in very simple, concrete meanings such as "konde いる", the state
of being "komu", and that means "crowded": a lot of people crammed
into the same space, crowded.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Now, it can have more abstract
meanings like "complicated", which is essentially the same: a lot
of ideas, a lot of concepts, crammed into the same mental space,
that's complication.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And then it becomes attached as a
helper verb to the い-stem of other verbs.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So we have "tobikomu", which means
"jump in".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">It can mean literally jump into the
water or something, but it can also mean jumping vigorously into a
conversation, a situation, or any of the other metaphorical uses of
"jumping in".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">It can become more abstract, with
concepts like "damarikomu".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Damaru" means to "be
silent".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Damarikomu" means to "be quiet"
about something / "clam up" about something, in other words, be
quiet and keep everything komu-ed up inside oneself, not letting
anything out.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Now, the word "yomikomu"is one that
you'll see often if you have your computer or your tablet or
whatever in Japanese.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">(And if you haven't, why not?)
You'll often see the word come up "yomikomichuu".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Now, "-chuu" means "in process
of".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">It means literally "in the middle
of"-- another metaphor, because literally it means "middle"or
"center"or "inside".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">But in this case, when it's attached
to a verb like this, "chuu" means "in the process of".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">As we might say in English, "in the
middle of doing something".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Yomikomichuu"is "being in the
process of yomikomu-ing", and "yomikomu" here means
"loading".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">It means "reading and cramming in":
reading data and putting it into memory.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">But the word has various other
meanings, and while they are different, they're all based on the
same fundamental metaphor.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So "yomikomu"can mean reading
something several times, reading it thoroughly.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Komu"can mean doing something
repeatedly, because again it's cramming in iterations of doing it,
cramming in reps, you might say.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">But it can mean reading thoroughly,
it can mean reading repeatedly, in any case it means cramming the
subject matter into your mind.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And again, "yomikomu"can mean
reading something into something: somebody says something or you
see a text, and you put in extra meaning which you believe to be
there.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And very often it is.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Texts can have
implications.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Reading something into something
again can be "yomikomu".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And again it's a very obvious and
natural use of the metaphor.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And once again, "yomikomu"can mean
reading poetry or something with feeling, with emotion.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">You're not just reading it; you're
putting something into it, you're putting in the emotion, you're
cramming it with something, with emotion, with feeling, with
expression.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So, all these meanings of "yomikomu"
are different and yet all of them essentially conform to the same
metaphor: read and cram something in.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Now, another common compounded verb
with "komu"is "omoikomu".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Now, the most common use of that, I
would say, is to "be under the impression / to be convinced
of"something, usually something that turns out not to be true, but
that doesn't have to be the case.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So, "omoi"is "thought" and "komu"is
"cramming in", so you have this thought crammed in, or this set of
thoughts crammed into your mind.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Whether they're true or not, they're
in there, they're lodged in your mind.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And, interestingly, in older
English, people sometimesused to talk about "cramming"someone,
meaning filling them up with wrong ideas, giving them false
impressions, cramming into their mind a particular set of ideas
which would generally not be correct, at least in the opinion of
the speaker.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So "omoikomu"in that sense usually
means having a strong impression, a strong belief, a strong notion
that something is the case that probably in fact isn't.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">But "omoikomu"can mean other things
as well.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">It can mean "being in love" and it
can mean " having one's heart set"on something.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And in order to understand that, we
need to know a little more about the word "omoi", which, as I
pointed out toward the end of another video, doesn't necessarily
just mean "thought"or "feeling".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">It can also mean "love"or
"desire".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So, for example, the word "kataomoi"
means "one-sided love".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Kata"generally means "side"or
"direction" and "kataomoi"is "one-sided or one-directional love /
unrequited love".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So "omoi" there is being used in the
sense of "love / affection /desire".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So "omoikomu"can mean "being in
love".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">It can also mean " having one's
heart set on something", and that doesn't necessarily mean loving a
person.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">It could mean having one's heart set
on going on a picnic, or anything.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">The point here is that "omoi"in the
sense of desire and love is crammed into one.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">It's not just a passing whim, it's
something that one's whole heart is set on, something "crammed
in".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">We'll come across a few other
meanings of "komu" too, especially when it's used, as it very often
is, as a helper verb put onto the い-stem of another
verb.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">But once we understand this point,
that it's to do with cramming, that it's to do with filling, that
it's to do with thoroughness, completeness, or with locking away,
then we can understand how these other words are going to work when
we hear them.</span></p>

as usual.</span></p>

<h1 class="c15" id="h.8aj5s3to56e0"><span class="c18">Lesson 58:
Japanese double particles. How they really work | lesson
58</span></h1>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">こんにちは.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Today we're going to talk about
"combined particles"or "double particles"or whatever silly names
the textbooks and Japanese grammar sites call them by.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And I'll explain in just a moment
why I'm calling them "silly".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">What I'm referring to is particles
in combinations like "には ", "に-mo", "と は ", "-noが"etc.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And if you look at the sites you'll
find lots of rules like "you can use に with は and も, but you can't
use it withが or で "; "you can use と with this, but not that", and
so on.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And you don't need to learn any of
these rules.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">If you understand what's going on
and why it's happening, it all makes complete logical
sense.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">There are no random rules happening
here, just straightforward logic.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">The reason it gets so confusing in
English-language so-called Japanese grammar is because they're not
just giving the wrong answers.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">They're giving the wrong answers to
the wrong questions.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">They're posing questions that should
never have been posed in the first place.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">There's really no such thing as a
"double particle"or a "combined particle".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">What's happening all the time is
that the particles are just doing their job the way they always
do.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So what about all these random rules
about when they can do it and when they can't? Well, all these are
actually based in what the particles are and what they actually
do.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So, the first distinction to make,
that the textbooks and websites never make, is the distinction
between logical and non-logical particles.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">This is absolutely
crucial.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So, let's start by looking at the
five main logical particles.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">These are the particles that tell us
what's going on in the sentence.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">They mark each noun with the role it
plays in the sentence, whether it's the person doing something, the
thing that's being done, the thing it's being done to, the place
where it's being done, etc.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">etc.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Now, the first obvious thing to
understand is that you can't combine any of these five logical
particles with any of the others.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Why not? Because of what they
do.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">They mark each noun with its
function in the sentence.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">A noun can't actually be more than
one part of speech at the same time, so it would just make no sense
at all to combine any of these five together with each
other.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">But what you can combine them with
is non-logical particles, notably the two non-logical topic
markers, は and -mo.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">You can combine these because they
don't clash logically.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">は and も don't tell us anything about
what a noun is doing in the sentence.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">It's only ever marking that thing as
a topic, either to make it the topic of the sentence or to make it
a sub と pic for strategic reasons, which we'll talk about in a
moment.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Now, the next thing to know is that
the two primary particles, or the primary and secondary particle,
that is,が and を, don't combine with non-logical
particles.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Why don't they? Well,が is the
primary particle: it has to be in every sentence of every kind; を
is the secondary particle: it marks the direct object.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">This means that in any sentence that
is directly transitive, を has to be present, whether we can see it
or not.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Now, what do I mean by directly
transitive? All the textbooks and the dictionaries confuse
transitivity with Japanese self-move and other-move
verbs.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And in a way this is understandable,
because there's a large overlap between the two.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">But they aren't the same
thing.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So let's look here at what we mean
by actual transitivity.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">If I say "I walk", "I sing", "I
eat", those are all intransitive because I'm doing the verb and I'm
not doing it to anything else.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">It has no direct object.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">If I say "I sing a song"or "I read a
book"or "I eat bread", then this is transitive because the verb has
a direct object.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Now, when I say "directly
transitive", what I mean is verbs that are done directly to an
object.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So, for example, I can say "I talk
to Sakura" but in English, as you see, we have to have a
preposition there.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">We're not saying "I talk Sakura", so
we're not directly transitive, we're indirectly transitive through
the medium of a preposition.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Now, Japanese has the same
distinction.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">We don't say "Sakura を 話す", which
would be the equivalent in English of "I talk Sakura".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">We say "Sakura と 話す"or "Sakuraに
話す".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Now, please don't from this run away
with the idea that particles like に and と are the same as English
prepositions.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">They're not.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">If you're going to compare them to
anything in European languages, you have to compare all the logical
particles to the German or Latin case structures.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">You may not know what those are and
you don't need to, because I model these in ways that don't require
knowledge of European grammar.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">But the point here is that they're
not prepositions, but for our purposes here we can say that they're
used under the same circumstances that prepositions get used in
English.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So if we say "I eat bread", that's
directly transitive.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">If we say "I talk to Sakura", that's
indirectly transitive.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">In Japanese, if we use the を
particle, it's directly transitive.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">If we use another particle, like と
or に, it's indirectly transitive.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">In some cases English and Japanese
will disagree about what is directly transitive and what's
indirectly transitive, but an awful lot of the time they're in fact
in agreement because these are fairly basic factors of human
communication.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Now, the point here is that these
two direct particles -- if we say "I hit Sakura" there are no
prepositions anywhere.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">This is completely
direct.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">I do the hitting and I'm hitting
something, I'm hitting Sakura.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">I'm not hitting to Sakura or hitting
at Sakura or hitting by Sakura.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">I'm directly hitting
Sakura.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Now, because of the directness of
these two particles they can't have a non-logical particle appended
to them.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So, if you want to use a non-logical
particle here, you can do it.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">But the way you do it is always by
simply attaching the non-logical particle and leaving the logical
particle out.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And because these are so fundamental
to every sentence, they can be understood by the hearer in
Japanese.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So, if we say "Sakuraは nagutta" --
"I hit Sakura"-- this means "Sakuraは , zero を nagutta", but we
don't say "Sakuraは を nagutta"or "Sakuraをは nagutta".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Because you can't put anything
between these two direct fundamental logical particles and the
thing they directly connect to.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So now we understand the basis for
practically all the strange rules that you're going to hear
about.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">You just need to remember these two
facts: you can't pair one of these main five logical particles with
any of the other four and you can't put a non-logical particle
before or after the two primary particlesが and を.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Now, once we know that, what have we
got left and how does it work? We can pair non-logical particles
with any of the remaining logical particles.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And the reason we're doing this is
not to make some kind of weird, unusual
pair-combination.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">We're simply using the functions of
both at the same time.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So the most straightforward thing we
do here is simply make something into a topic.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">If we say "fuyuには yukidaruma を
tsukuru", we're saying "In the winter we make a snowman."Now, we
could say "fuyuに yukidaruma を tsukuru".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">We don't have to have the は
there.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So why would we choose sometimes to
have a は there? Well, in this case we're making it the topic of the
sentence.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">We're saying " here's
winter/speaking of winter, this is what we do." and it also plays
the other roles that は always plays as an extension of its
topic-making nature.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And I've done a video on these
multiple uses of は , so if you're not familiar with this, please
take a look at it, because it's rather important for understanding
what's going on here.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So, we're making a topic out of the
winter and we're also differentiating winter from other
seasons.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">We're saying "fuyuには "--" as for
winter, as opposed to the other seasons, we make a snowman."Now, if
the person you were talking to was someone from a very, very cold
place, they might say " haruに-mo yukidaruma を tsukuru".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So what they're saying is "we make a
snowman in the spring as well."So we can use the exclusive particle
は or the inclusive particle -mo.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And both of them add that degree of
meaning.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Now why do we have the に here?
Because we actually need the に.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">We need the に to mark the fact that
we're doing an activity at a particular time.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">This is the logical function of
に.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And having done that, we can also
make a topic out of it.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And that's simply what we're doing
here.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">In other cases we might say "明日
gakkouに 行く" and that simply means I'm going to school.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">If we say "明日 gakkouには 行く", the
implication is that we're going to school but we're not going
somewhere else that they thought we might be going.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">If we say "明日 gakkouに-mo 行く", we're
saying I'm going to school as well as somewhere else that you
already know about.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So you see, in each of these cases
our non-logical particle is simply adding meaning to the logical
particle that's already there.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">They don't clash, because one is
logical and the other is non-logical, so they're not telling us
conflicting information.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">They're telling us complementary
information.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And that's why you can use them that
way and why you can't combine one logical particle with another
logical particle or one non-logical particle with another
non-logical particle.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Now, there are other particles that
can pair with other particles, but again, this whole pairing
concept is the wrong way of looking at it.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">As always the particles are simply
doing what they do.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">For example, the の particle, if it's
the nominalizing -no, the の that turns something into a noun, so,
for example, "oyogu-no"is "swimming", the noun "swimming", the
activity called "swimming".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">We can say "Oyogu-noが 好き
です".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">We can say "Oyogu の を
します".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">You can combine any logical particle
with の because that kind of の turns the thing before it into what
is effectively a noun, and a noun can take any of the logical
particles.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">It could be a longer logical clause:
"Sakura と isshoに oyogu-noが 好き だ" -- "I like swimming together with
Sakura".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">But the point is that once you've
put that nominalizing の onto the end of it, when it's the の that
turns something into a noun, you then treat it as a
noun.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And what do you do with a noun? You
put a logical particle onto it, don't you? So, this is simple
logic.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">If you have any questions or
comments, please put them in the Comments below and I will answer

<h1 class="c15" id="h.dmh6xqd2p5m8"><span class="c18">Lesson 59:
Untranslatable Japanese exists! How to understand it</span></h1>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">こんにちは.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Today we're going to talk about
something that makes quite a range of Japanese sentences difficult
for English learners to understand.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And that is something that I call
"the problem of passivity in Japanese".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And I'm not talking here about the
so-called Japanese passive, which is actually the receptive helper
verb.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">That's a problem because of the
tendency to call it passive when it isn't, but there are actually
several Japanese constructions that go deeper than this and cause
problems by being regarded and translated as passive even though
they're not actually called passive.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And this matters because if we see
them as being passive, then we're going to misunderstand the
sentences, we're not going to understand why the logical particles
are in the places that they are and, especially with more complex
sentences, we're just not going to be able to work out what's going
on at all.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Now, as I've said before, there is
not any actual passive voice in Japanese, but something to consider
here is that there is something that we can call the passive nature
of Japanese as a whole.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And this has nothing to do with the
grammatical passive voice as it exists in English.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">This is more of a philosophical than
a grammatical passivity.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And by "passive" here I simply mean
the opposite of active.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">As I've explained before, the Adam
and Eve of Japanese verbs are "ある" and "する", "ある"meaning "be" and
"する"meaning "do".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And while we call them the "adam and
Eve", we should really refer to them as the "Eve and Adam", because
there is a tendency in Japanese to regard "being" as prior and
primary to "doing", whereas English tends to think of things the
other way around.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">It tends to be activist in
nature.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And there are a whole range of
Japanese verbs which depict not actions as we understand them but
states of being which are regarded grammatically as if they were in
fact actions.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And again, understanding that this
is the case is vitally important to understanding how sentences
work.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And we can start this off with
something that isn't in fact usually translated as passive but
would be a little bit better if it were translated as passive and
that is something we've looked at already in another context, which
is that if we say "本が 分かる", this gets translated into English as "I
understand the book" and it doesn't mean that at all, because as we
can see the book is the が marked subject of the
sentence.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So it's the book that's doing
something, not me.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">I'm not doing anything.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And in fact it does much less
violence to the structure of the sentence if we translate it as
"the book is understandable (to me)".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">This is almost what the Japanese is
saying.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">The book is the subject and it's the
book that's actually doing the action.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">The reason "the book is
understandable to me"is not a perfect translation is because, as
you can see, this is not in fact an A-is-B sentence.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So we shouldn't be saying "the book
is understandable (to me)." what we have to say to get the Japanese
right is "the book does understandable (to me)." and of course that
makes no sense at all in English because in English "being
understandable"is regarded as a state.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">But in Japanese it's regarded as an
action, what we might call a "stative action", a being-kind of
action, like "being"itself.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Even in English we can say that
something "exists".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">But generally speaking, English
requires things to be jumping about doing something in order to say
that they're taking any kind of action.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">But in Japanese the action of
existing in particular states is often expressed by a
verb.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And this is important because it
extends to a whole range of Japanese words, to "出来る" and to any
verb which has the potential helper attached.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So if we say "日本語が 出来る" it gets
translated as "I can do Japanese"or "I can speak Japanese", which
is even stranger because there's no "speak"in there and what it's
actually saying is that "Japanese is possible (to me)", but again
this is an A-is-B construction when in fact this is really an
A-does-B sentence.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">What it's saying is "Japanese does
possible (to me)".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Now, this may seem like a bit of a
quibble, but it's not a quibble because the particles, the
structure, the entire framework of the sentence is
different.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And in simple sentences like this it
may not be very important but as sentences become more complicated,
this whole issue becomes more important because we start to run
into sentences that are quite impossible to understand unless we
recognize what their actual structure is.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And there is a whole range of verbs
that refer to what in English would be called states.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And in these cases the English
translations are always passive.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And they have to be passive, because
there really isn't a way, another way of saying them in
English.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">For example, "midareru"-- to be
scattered or disordered; "kakeru"-- to be chipped or damaged or
insufficient; "Utusuru"-- to be reflected or projected.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Each of those, as you see, I've
translated with the English passive because it's the only way to
translate them into natural English.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">But they're not in fact passive in
Japanese.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">These are regarded as actions done
by the thing which is disordered, the thing which is damaged, the
thing which is reflected.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So if there's no alternative to
translating them as passive, aren't we justified in doing so? And
the answer to that is, yes of course we are absolutely justified in
doing so if what we're trying to do is tell someone who doesn't
know Japanese and isn't learning Japanese what is being said or,
more accurately, what would be being said by an English speaker in
the same circumstance.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">But if, as learners of Japanese, we
don't know what the sentence is actually doing, we're going to get
ourselves into an awful tangle.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">We're going to look at sentences and
wonder what they mean and if we try to make our own sentences we
just won't be able to do it because we'll be looking for passive
constructions, we'll be trying to build sentences according to
principles that we haven't been introduced to and don't
understand.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So the thing to understand here is
that in Japanese verbs can and often do represent what in English
can only be expressed as either states of being or passive
actions.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And then there is another group of
verbs which is closely related in type to this in which they get
translated as "becoming" a particular thing: "nureru"-- to become
wet; "nigoru"-- to become cloudy or muddy.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Again, in Japanese this isn't talked
about as "becoming" anything.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">It's simply an action in
itself.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">If we wanted to find a way of
putting it in English we'd have to invent a word like "muddify"or
"cloudify"or "wetiniflicate", but in fact of course these words
don't exist in English.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And the key to understanding them in
Japanese is not to try to translate them into English but to see
how they're actually working in the Japanese and to be aware that
one-for-one translations are not possible in these
cases.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And these becomingをrds like
"nigoru"or "nureru"can also be used in the continuous present to
get us back to our passive states that we had with the other
words.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So, say, "nigote いる": we're saying
what in English can only be translated as to "be cloudy", but in
Japanese, again, it's to "exist in a state of
cloudiness".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So this is quite a simple and
straightforward issue, but it's very important that we absorb and
understand this principle or we're going to have a lot of trouble
with a whole range of Japanese expressions.</span></p>

<h1 class="c15" id="h.cc53f8fdop9x"><span class="c18">Lesson 60:
The OTHER HALF of Japanese Structure - non-logical topic/comment
structure</span></h1>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">こんにちは.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Today we're going to talk about one
of the most important subjects in Japanese structure.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">In fact this is the other half of
Japanese structure.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">We've referred to it on many
occasions.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">You can't really do much Japanese
without it.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">But we've never tackled it head-on,
and that's what we're going to do now.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">What we're going to talk about is
topic - comment structure.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And this is just as important as
logical, subject - predicate, A-car - B-engine,
structure.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">In my book "Unlocking Japanese", I
referred toが as the king of Japanese and は as the queen of
Japanese.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">が is the head of the logical
particles, the logical side of the language.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">は is the head of the non-logical
particles and strategies, the non-logical side of the
language.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And we can go so far as to say that
not only does every Japanese sentence have a が marked A-car,
whether we can see it or not, every Japanese sentence also has a
は-marked topic, whether we can see it or not.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So what is a topic? Every language
has topic; most languages are not, like Japanese,
topic-prominent.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">But to explain what a topic is in
English, here's a very quick example.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">In English, we track topics by using
pronouns, and that's why English uses so many pronouns.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">That's why it's saying "it" at the
time.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So, we can say "I had a
ball.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">It rolled down the hill.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">It reached the bottom.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">It was a red ball." as you see, each
time the ball is marked by "it", and you might say that what's
being tracked here is the subject, because it was the ball that
rolled down the hill, it was the ball that reached the bottom, it
was the ball that was red.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">But we could also say "I had a
ball.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">I dropped it.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">It rolled down the hill.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">When it reached the bottom, Sakura
picked it up and walked away with it."Now, you see, the first
"it"is the object of my dropping it: "I dropped it." the second and
third "it": "It rolled down the hill...</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">it reached the bottom"-- in those
two the ball is the subject.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And then "Sakura picked it up", and
it's become the object again, the object this time of Sakura's
action.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So "it"is not tracking the subject,
it's not tracking the object, it's tracking the topic, the thing
we're talking about.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">That's what a topic is.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And as I said, Japanese always has a
topic, even though we can't always see it.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So, if we say "アメリカ人 です", usually we
would map that out as "zeroが アメリカ人 です" -- "I am an American", but
to be completely thorough we would have to map it as "zeroは zeroが
アメリカ人 です", that is "I am the topic, I am the subject, and I'm an
American." we don't have to go through all that every time, but
it's important to know that it exists.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">When the topic and the subject are
the same, it's not so important, but as we know they often
aren't.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And in Japanese much more than in
English they very often aren't.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So, in sentences like "コーヒーが 好き だ" ,
"atamaが itai", "onakaが suita", "クレープが 食べたい" , all of these are
complete logical sentences: "Coffee is likeable" ; " head hurts" ;
"Stomach is empty" ; "Crepes are eat wanted".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">In each case we have an A-car, we
have a B-engine, we have a complete logical clause.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">But while it's logically complete,
it isn't grammatically complete without understanding that there is
also an invisible は-marked topic: "zeroは コーヒーが 好き だ" ; "zeroは
atamaが itai" ; "zeroは onakaが suita" ; "zeroは クレープが
食べたい".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"In relation to me, coffee is
likeable/pleasing" ; "In relation to me, head hurts" ; "In relation
to me, stomach is empty" ; "In relation to me, crepes are eatは
nt-inducing".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And while, as with the zero が marked
pronoun, the default is "I" but it doesn't have to be "I", so the
は-marked zero-pronoun the same applies.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">For example, if we look at a tall
person go by and we say "se が t赤い, ne", literally, "back is high,
isn't it?" and that's the way we say someone is tall.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">But as you see, this isn't complete
without the は-marked zero pronoun: "zeroは se が t赤い" -- "In relation
to that person, back is tall".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And because Japanese has so many
constructions that don't center on an ego, as we talked about in
one of our previous videos, so many constructions in which neither
the A-car nor the B-engine are in fact the person concerned, like
all the examples we've just talked about, it's very necessary in
lots of cases that we understand that the は-marked topic is
there.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And the other thing we need to
understand about topic-comment structure is that the comment is
always a complete logical clause.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">The topic is usually a noun (it
could be something else) but the comment is always and must always
be a complete logical clause.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">This is something the textbooks
don't explain, and it may be a good thing that they don't explain
it, because if they did, I think we know how they'd go about
it.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">They'd present this as some kind of
strange Oriental rule that we have to memorize.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">But that's not what it is: it's a
logical necessity.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">As we know, every sentence, every
logical clause, must have an A-car and a B-engine, a subject and a
predicate, and as we know from our third lesson on は , は can never
mark either the A-car or the B-engine, or any other element of a
logical sentence.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">It can only mark the non-logical
topic.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So that means that if we're going to
have a sentence at all, both its elements have to be outside of the
topic.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">We have to have a topic and we also
have to have an A-car, we also have to have a B-engine.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Therefore, every topic-comment
sentence only has two elements, the topic and the
comment.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Both the elements of the logical
clause have to be in the comment.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Therefore, logically, in a
topic-comment sentence the comment is always a logical
clause.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">In another video I've talked, and
I'm going to talk again, about some of the implications of what is
called the choice between は and が; what it means when we mark
something with は , what it means when we mark it with が.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And there are a lot of implications
involved here.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">I won't go into them in this video
but you can watch the other one and I'll put a card up for
that.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">But the thing to remember here
because we're talking about the actual structure, is that when
people talk about the choice between は and が, it's confusing and
somewhat misleading because it implies that は andが are somewhat
similar, that they do a similar kind of job.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And we know that they
don't.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">We know that they're absolutely
different species of particle.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And what we know from this lesson is
that what we're actually doing when we're making a choice between は
andが is that we're choosing which of two elements which are always
present to make visible, whether we make the は visible, the が
visible, or neither visible.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So we can say "アメリカ人 です", we can say
"私は アメリカ人 です", and we can say "私が アメリカ人 です".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And each of those has a slightly
different implication.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">When we're not actually choosing
between は and が, what we're choosing to do is to emphasize, by
making it visible, the topic-nature of the subject or the
subject-nature of the topic, or neither.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And which of those we choose to
emphasize has big implications for what we're saying and what we're
implying.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And as I say, I've already talked
about that and I'll be talking more about that later.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">If you have any questions or
comments, please put them in the Comments below and I will answer
as usual.</span></p>

and GA: the Deeper Secrets! The yin- や ng structure of
Japanese</span></h1>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">こんにちは.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Today we're going to talk about the
subtler meanings of the wa- and が particles and the implications
they can have in different uses.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Last week we looked at the fact that
topic-comment structure is fundamental to Japanese.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Every Japanese sentence has a topic
as well as a subject, so that we can say that where the topic and
the subject are not made explicit, Japanese sentences have both an
invisible が and an invisible は .</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So, "日本人 です", meaning "I am a
Japanese person", is strictly "zeroは zeroが 日本人 です" -- "I am the
topic, I am the subject, and I am a Japanese person."On the whole,
we don't need to worry about the invisible は , and that's because
in English and related languages we don't normally need to have the
topic made explicit.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">We do need to have the subject
repeatedly made explicit, so we feel a bit lost if we don't know
where it is.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And that's why we use the invisible
が model.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">But the important thing that we
concluded in our last lesson was that the so-called choice between
は and が, which only exists, of course, in sentences where the topic
and the subject happen to be the same thing, and what we're doing
is not really making a topic or making a subject: we are
emphasizing the fact that something is either the topic or the
subject.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And this choice is important for the
implication we're going to throw on that topic/subject.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And in order to understand the
implication, we do have to have some idea of what is the most
natural way of putting a thing.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And this is why I always say that
structure is important, but you can't understand Japanese with
structure alone.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">You have to have enough immersion to
understand what sounds natural.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And from that plus the use of
structure you can understand what implications are being made by a
particular statement.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Now, when we treat something as a
topic and mark it with は or も, this can't be new
information.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Just as in English if we say,
"Speaking of Melfrog Pooftoofular", it's no good saying that if
your hearer doesn't know who or what "Melfrog
Pooftoofular"is.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">You have to start by introducing
"Melfrog Pooftoofular"first.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So a topic-marker can only mark old
information.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And this is important because old
information is unimportant information.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">New information is what you are
actually trying to convey to someone.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">This is the way language
works.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">We're not supposed to be telling
people things they already know.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">We're supposed to be adding
something that they don't know, and that is the actual information
content of the statement.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So, in a certain way, は works like
"the"in English, only in this one respect, that it can't mark new
information.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So if we say "I fed the iguana",
unless people already know about this iguana, they're immediately
going to say, "what iguana? You never talked about any iguana
before.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">What are you talking about, 'the
iguana'?"If you say "I fed an iguana", that's all right.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And we also need to understand that
this concept of old versus new information and important versus
unimportant information is closely bound up.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So you can in fact say "I fed the
dog" without anybody knowing that you even had a dog, because it's
very normal and natural for a person to have a dog.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">They don't particularly want to stop
and have that point explained anyway.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So "I fed the dog" will be taken to
mean "I fed the dog that I keep at home, even though you didn't
know I kept a dog at home, you do now".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">If I say "I fed the iguana", that's
a conversation stopper.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">If you don't introduce the iguana
first, nobody's going to just take it as read -- "Yes-yes, she's
got an iguana at home, like most people."So you see that while we
say linguistically "new information"versus "old information", it's
a bit subtler than that.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">It's "new, important, relevant
information"versus "old information or information that we can
easily take as read".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And even this is quite a
heavy-handed way of describing it.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Let's take a look at how this sort
of thing works in practice in Japanese.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">If we say " hon を katta", this is
the most normal way of saying "I bought a book".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">As we know, the zero-pronoun
defaults to "I" when the context isn't telling us that it's
anything else.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So " hon を katta"puts no particular
emphasis on anything; it's just saying, neutrally, "I bought a
book".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Now, in this sentence, "I"is the
subject and the topic.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">If we choose to stress "I" as the
topic and say "私は 本 を katta", we're making "私"into the old
information, the buying of the book into the new information, and
because of this, は has a distinguishing function.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">When we use は , we are either
establishing or changing the topic.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And even establishing a topic is in
most cases changing it, because we can assume there was some topic
before.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So we're changing the topic to "I"
and saying that I bought a book.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And we know that what は does is not
only change the topic to whatever it marks (in this case "I") but
it also implies that the comment on the new topic is different from
the comment on the old topic.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And if there wasn't in fact an old
topic, it still implies that it's different from the comment on
other possible topics.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So, "私は 本 を katta"is essentially
saying "what I did was bought a book.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">You may have bought something else,
other people may not have bought anything at all, but what I did
was buy a book." we're stressing the fact that I bought a book as
opposed to other possible topics who didn't buy a book.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">This means that it is implicitly the
answer to a question which may not in fact have been asked: "what
did you do?" the answer to "what did I do?"is "I bought a book"
when you're marking "I" with は .</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Now, if you say "私が hon を katta",
you've changed the emphasis.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">You've reversed the
emphasis.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">The old information is now the
buying of the book and the new information is "I".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So under what circumstances do you
say that? Well, suppose people are looking at an empty space in the
bookshelf and wondering what happened, and you say "私が hon を katta"
-- "I'm the one who bought the book." we all know that the book's
gone, we know something happened to the book, now I'm giving you
the new information: "I" am the one who bought the book.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So while "私は 本 を katta"is implicitly
the answer to the question "what did you do?", "私が hon を katta"is
implicitly the answer to "who bought the book?"It's also important
to understand what is the natural, neutral way of saying
something.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">We know in this case that the
natural, neutral way of saying "I bought a book" without
emphasizing anything is just to say " hon を katta".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So if we say "私は "or "私が", we're
specifically making a point here.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">We're adding something to the
neutral statement that I bought a book.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Now, from this direction of the
emphasis forward or backward, は andが can mark particularities as
opposed to generalities.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So, for example, if we say " hanaが
きれい だ" , we're stressing the " hana" as the subject and this means
"the flower (or these flowers) are pretty".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Pretty"is important, but the real
subject is "these flowers".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">These flowers are what is pretty,
these are pretty flowers.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">If we say " hanaは きれい だ" , we are
likely to be saying that flowers in general are pretty.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">We haven't singled out any flowers
as the subject; we've made "flowers" the topic, and the important
new information is prettiness.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Flowers in themselves are not
new.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">They're something we've known about
for a long time.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">The fact that they're pretty is my
comment, my assessment of them.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">" hanaが きれい だ" -- the flowers are
taken to be something new.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">They're taken to be a particular
subject in themselves and so we're more likely to be talking about
particular flowers instead of flowers in general.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Now, all the time we're talking
about tendencies here, aren't we? There's no logical, structural
reason why saying "I fed the iguana"is any different from saying "I
fed the dog".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">It becomes different because of
expectations.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">We expect someone is very likely to
have a dog and so this is not new or important
information.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">We don't expect someone to have an
iguana, so this counts as new, important information and you can't
slip it by with a "the"in the same way that you can the
dog.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Similarly,が can mark new material as
well as old material, but は can't mark new material.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">は can mark specific things as well
as generalities butが can't really mark generalities.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So we're talking about fairly subtle
shades here.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Now, knowing the usual way of saying
something, again, is what gives using a different strategy its
emphasis.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So, as I spoke about in an earlier
video on は andが (which I would recommend seeing, because it covers
some material I'm not covering here) we know that "雨が futte いる"
means "it's raining".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">This is the normal way to say it's
raining.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">We use が.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">We can't use nothing because we have
to say what's falling, and we don't normally use は .</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So "雨が futte いる"simply means "rain
is falling".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">" ameは futte いる" is something you'd
say when perhaps there was an expectation that it was going to
snow.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Rain is the topic and the comment on
it is that it's falling, with the implication that if the topic
were different the comment would also be different, because we're
using は not も, and は is the exclusive topic-marker as opposed to も,
which is the inclusive topic-marker.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Now, it's not only used for
differentiation; it's also used because it throws emphasis
forward.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">It's also used for
emphasis.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So I'm going to take an example here
from one of my favorite anime, which is Aria the
animation.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Unfortunately, I don't think it has
any Japanese subtitles, so you may have to wait a little while
before you watch that.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">I know you never watch anything with
English subtitles any more and I congratulate you for
that.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So the sentence is "omae みたい na
hanninmaeに や sumiは nai".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"omae みたい na hanninmaeに や sumiは
nai." and what this means is "For trainees like you, there are no
rests".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Now, it's interesting to notice
what's going on here.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">What is the topic of this sentence?
Actually, it's "trainees like you": "omae みたい na hanninmaeに"could
have been "omae みたい na hanninmaeには "and this would made a topic out
of "trainees like you", and the comment on this would be the
logical clause " や sumiが ない" -- "there are no rests".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">However, the speaker has chosen to
do something different.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">She's chosen to de-emphasize the
topic by not marking it with は , but this doesn't stop it being the
topic.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">It's still the topic on which the
logical clause is a comment.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And she's made a sub と pic out of "
や sumi" -- "rests".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Why has she done that? Because when
you make something a topic, even if it's a kind of sub と pic like
this, you're throwing the emphasis forward onto what follows
it.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">You're making the thing that follows
it the salient, the important information of the
sentence.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So, what it's saying here is " や
sumiは nai" -- "as for rests, they don't exist": "For trainees like
you, as for rests, they don't exist."Now, this isn't quite as
cumbersome as it sounds in English because は is a much more
flexible particle that can be used much more easily than things
like "as for"in English.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">But it's using the same essential
strategy to throw all the emphasis of that entire sentence onto
that last word, "ない" -- "they don't exist" -- "forget about rests,
you're not getting any."Now, I hope this makes the topic-marking は
and the subject-markingが a little bit clearer in their deeper and
subtler implications.</span></p>

<h1 class="c15" id="h.2r6e5btnvvti"><span class="c18">Lesson 62:
Te-oku vs te-shimau, helper verb secrets. ておく てしまう</span></h1>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">こんにちは.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Today we're going to start talking
about what I call the bridge between structural learning and actual
immersion, because we learn expressions and structures and then
sometimes when we encounter them in real use we don't understand
quite what they're doing there.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">I'm going to take an example from my
patron Kimika-sama, who gives me this sentence: "Kaku dantaiには 私から
yoku setsumei してoku."Now, Kimika-sama is able to translate this
pretty much correctly (it means broadly in English "I will give
each group a good explanation from me"), but still doesn't
understand why "oku"is used as a helper verb to "setsumei
する".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And to understand that more fully, I
think we need to look into something a little more
deeply.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">This is the fact that Japanese
people are very fond of their helper verbs and they attach them
quite often in various kinds of circumstance.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Is this something we can understand
from an English point of view? I would say yes, it is.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">We do the same thing in English,
though not so much with verbs as with prepositions, particularly
the prepositions "up" and "out".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">We eat things up, we make things up,
we cry out, we lose out, we think up an idea, we think out an idea,
etcetera etcetera.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Now, Japanese doesn't have any
prepositions.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">None at all.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">If you think it has, it's time to
throw that textbook out of the window.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">What it uses in place of these
English prepositions "up", "out", etcetera, are verbs -- helper
verbs.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And the difference between the
Japanese helper verb and the English verb-helper preposition is
first of all that there are a lot more of them and then, because of
that, they're a lot more specific.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">If you look at the various ways in
which English speakers use "up and "out"-- they even "peace out",
whatever that means -- you can see that because there are only a
few of them they get used all over the place in all kinds of
circumstances and there's only a marginal amount of reason to the
way they're used.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Now, because there are more helper
verbs, they can be much more targeted.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So, even though they're used widely,
in a whole range of situations, we can generally tell what any
given helper verb is doing, if we understand that we need a fairly
wide interpretation.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So what "て oku"is doing here is
really what it always does.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">If we say "mado を akete oku", what
we're saying is "open the window in order that the window will be
open and probably that ventilation is going to come into the
room".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Open it for a purpose, put that
action in place: "oku", which means "put in a place".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Put that action in place so that it
will then change the circumstance in the way that we
want.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">In this case, airing out the
room.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And the same with the "setsumei"
here.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"setsumei してoku"-- put the act of
explaining, or the explanation, in place, so that, after that, each
group will understand what's going on, they won't be in the dark
about it any more.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Now, we can compare this with
another very common helper verb, which is "shimau" and its various
variants like "chatta", "jatta"etc.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">We could say "setsumei してshimau",
but that would have a completely different implication.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">In this particular case it would
probably mean something like "I'll go ahead and explain to them,
even though that's not what I'm expected to do, or perhaps not what
people want me to do.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">I'll just go right ahead and explain
to them" -- "setsumei してshimau."In another situation we might say
something like "Kikanai de yo.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Sakuraは setsumei してshimau kara",
which means "Don't ask, because Sakura will explain"-- but what
that "shimau"is implying is probably something like "Don't ask,
because if you do Sakura's going to explain and we're going to be
stuck here for hours with Sakura's long rambling explanations."So,
"shimau" has a wide variety of implications, some of them negative,
not all of them negative, but "oku" has a completely different
range of meaning.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Shimau"is talking about going ahead
and doing something, something happening by accident; as I said in
the video on "shimau", essentially when it's in the past, all those
things that we can mean by "done" -- "I done explained", "I done
fell over, "she done stole my cake", "I done won the lottery"--
doesn't have to be negative, but it has that exclamation mark
feeling to it.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">It happened, even though you might
not have been expecting it or you might not have wanted
it.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">It happened.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Oku"doesn't have that exclamation
mark feeling.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">It has that workman-like feeling: it
was done to put the action in place, to achieve a result, to change
the circumstance from what it was before into one that is more in
accordance with what we want, whether it be opening a window or
explaining to several groups what the situation is.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">If you have any questions or
comments, please put them in the Comments below and I will answer

<h1 class="c15" id="h.r9muc4oy7xi8"><span class="c18">Lesson 63:
WILD sentence enders in real life Japanese
かい、だい,、ぜ、ぞ、さ、から、し、ちょうだい</span></h1>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">こんにちは.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Today we're going to talk about some
more of those things that hit us between the eyes as soon as we
leave the walled garden of theoretical Japanese and venture into
the wild woods of the real thing.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">One of the things people often ask
me about are the various sentence-enders they encounter.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And I'm not talking about the tame
ones like "ne", "よ" and "na"-- I've done a video about those if
you're interested and I'll pop a link for that over my
head.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">But today we're going to talk about
some of the more colloquial and unconventional sentence-enders that
you're going to run into once you get into "wild Japanese"in anime,
manga, etc.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So, one of the ones I often get
asked about is "買い" , and "買い" is simply a softened and colloquial
form of "ka".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">As we know, "ka"is regularly used in
formal Japanese, where we use the です/ます decorations at the end of
sentences, to form questions.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So we say "Nani-nani します ka /
nani-nanい です ka".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">But in colloquial Japanese we don't
use "ka" as a sentence-ender question-marker all that
often.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">We do use it in other positions --
and I've done a video about the various ways we use "ka" and I'll
pop a link for that over my head too.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">But where we don't tend to use it in
informal speech, on the whole, is at the end of sentences marking
questions, the way it does in です/ます Japanese.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And that's not because it's
ungrammatical, in fact it's perfectly grammatical, but in modern
Japanese it's come to sound a little bit rough, so while you may
hear it between men who are being "one of the boys" together, you
don't hear it so often in female speech or in the speech of anyone
who's trying to be a bit courteous.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So what do we do? Most of the time
we simply use a rising intonation in speech or a question mark in
writing where we're depicting casual speech.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And there's nothing wrong with
this.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Spanish continually makes questions
by simply adding a rising intonation to the equivalent statement
and there are no problems there.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">There are no problems in Japanese
either.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Sometimes we add "の", which is
ambiguous, because it can mark either a question or a statement,
but again that doesn't really matter because intonation works just
as well.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">However, we do have the informal,
non-rough sounding question-marker "買い".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">You might think that would be used
all the time, but it isn't, because it sounds very colloquial
indeed and sometimes a little bit...</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">well, folksy.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Some sources say it's primarily
masculine and that's kind of halfは y true.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">You don't hear many younger female
speakers using it, but you do sometimes hear older female speakers
using it.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"買い" also has a partner, which is
"dai".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Dai"is really "だ" plus
"買い".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So this is the form of "買い" that we
use in copula-ending sentences, "だ" -ending sentences.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And just about everything I've said
about "買い" also applies to "dai", except that there is a particular
collocation, "dou dai", which is much more widely used.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So, if somebody's eating something
and you say "dou dai?" -- "what's it like? / how is it?"-- and they
might say "おいしい!"or they might say "mazui", but asking it in that
form is something anybody can do provided it's an informal
setting.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">People also come across the
expression "choudai", and that's not related to "買い" or "dai" at
all; it's an informal equivalent to "ください".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So it's usually adding it to the
て-form of a verb to ask someone to do something.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">It's sometimes considered to be
female speech but it is not exclusively so.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Other real sentence-ender markers in
casual speech are "ze", "zo" and "sa".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Now, "ze" and "zo" are very
simple.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">They're just verbal exclamation
marks which lend a little force to whatever it is you're
saying.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">They're quite rough and really are
masculine speech and they're the sort of thing you'll probably see
more in anime and manga than you will in real life.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Sa"is similar but it's not nearly
so rough.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">It's much more widely used, you'll
see a lot of it, and you'll hear it in real life.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">It tends to get called masculine
speech, but again it's not exclusively masculine speech.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">All kinds of people use
it.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">It's important not to confuse "sa",
the emphasis-lending sentence-ender, to "saa", which comes at the
beginning of a sentence and is more of a pause-for-thought kind of
expression.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Now, there are also sentence-enders
that are not sentence-enders but effectively they are, because
people do pop them after the engine at the end of a
sentence.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">One of these is から.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Now, から, as you know, is not
technically a sentence-ender.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">What it is is a conjunction that
joins two logical clauses to make a compound sentence.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So a proper use of からmight be: "さくらが
konai kara kaeriます", which means "because Sakura isn't coming, I'm
going home / Sakura isn't coming, so I'm leaving".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">However, you might simply say as you
are leaving, "さくらが konai kara", and that is just leaving the other
half of the sentence unsaid because it's obvious.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Now, from that, からcan be added to a
lot of sentences to imply that something else is coming.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">That extra something else isn't
always completely clear.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">In fact, the からmay be performing the
function of either softening what it marks or hardening
it.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">It can soften it by making the
statement feel explanatory; it can harden it by making it sound as
if it's part of a logical argument or a natural piece of reasoning
that the hearer ought to understand and agree with.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So, for example, if you're riding
your bicycle in a place where you shouldn't be riding a bicycle and
somebody official comes up to you and says "jitenshaに noru-noは
kinshい です kara"[polite tone], that's conciliatory, and really all
they want to say is "It's forbidden to ride a bicycle around here",
but by adding the から to the end of it, they're kind of softening
it, turning it into an explanation for you.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Conversely, they might say
"jitenshaに noru-noは kinshい です kara"[stern tone], and that has a
different implication.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">There, the "kinshi"is being rammed
home all the harder for that から.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So, からcan have a variety of uses,
often depending on context, on the way in which they're said, on
the demeanor of the person saying them, and on the whole
situation.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Shi"is another very common
sentence-ending particle which is similar to から and has a meaning
in the same area.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Shi"can actually combine various
conditions or statements, but its most common and regular use is to
combine reasons.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So, for example, we might say,
"osoku なった shi さくらが konai shi kaeriます", and that means "because
it's gotten late and because Sakura isn't coming, I'm going
home".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And this is the most standard kind
of use of "shi".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">But then we might often use it for
only one condition, implying others.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">For example, if we said "osoku なった
shi kaeriます", we're saying "because it's gotten late, I'm going
home", but we're also implying that the fact that it's gotten late
isn't the only reason: "because it's gotten late (and for other
reasons) I'm going home." and this, in this particular case,
probably implies that it's not just because it's getting late, it's
also because Sakura isn't coming, but we're leaving unstated the
more personal part of it.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Now conversely, we might say "さくらが
konai shi kaeriます" and this time we've put in the most important
part, the real reason for our leaving, but by saying "shi"rather
than から we're also saying "because Sakura isn't coming (and for
other reasons) I'm leaving." what this does is take the pressure
off Sakura.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Although she may be the main reason,
we're diffusing it a bit by suggesting that there are also other
reasons.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And we might do this when there are
no other reasons at all, just as a way of softening and diffusing
the statement.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Another example might be, suppose
you're riding your bicycle again in that place where you shouldn't
be riding it and this time a friend comes up to you and says,
"jitenshiに noru-noは kinshi shi".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Now, the difference between this and
the からstatement is simply that the "shi"is diffusing it.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">It's saying "Oh, because it's
forbidden to ride a bicycle here and for other reasons..."Now,
there aren't any "other reasons" at all, but what this does is make
it sound a bit more colloquial, a bit more friendly, and it vagues
up a bit that から which can sound too much like an order.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">It's just saying "Oh, for that and
other reasons".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And this "vaguing up" tactic often
takes place in languages.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">In English it's often done by adding
words like "like"or "kinda" to what you're saying.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Now, the ways in which these
sentence-enders work can't be learned from structure alone or from
abstract instruction alone.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">We need to immerse in Japanese to
get the feel of what people mean when they say these
things.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">But conversely, understanding the
structure, understanding how they really fit together, gives us a
substantial boost in being able to make sense of our immersion It's
rather like a rope and climbing a mountain.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">If you have a rope, that will help
you climb the mountain, but if you just stand staring and learning
all about the rope you'll never get to the top of the
mountain.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Conversely, if you try to climb the
mountain without the rope, you may not get very far.</span></p>

<h1 class="c15" id="h.9m2sk0yy3noc"><span class="c18">Lesson 64:
"things"get Strange! Mono and こと: advanced secrets: ものだ, ことがある, こと
as sentence-ender</span></h1>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">こんにちは.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Today we're going to talk about "もの"
and "こと" in some of their more advanced senses.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Now, near the beginning of this
course we talked about "もの" and "こと", and I said what people
usually say, which is that "もの"is a concrete thing, like a pencil
or an apple or a tree, and "こと" is an abstract thing, like a
situation, a circumstance, an action.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Now, this is broadly true and it's
certainly the best way to grasp it in the beginning, but then we
come across some other situations which don't seem to fit in with
that.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">One of my Patrons wrote to discuss
the sentence: "aiは subaらしい mono だ" , which means "Love is a
wonderful thing".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Now, surely love is
abstract.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">You can't put it in a box and carry
it from Kyoto to Tokyo.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So what's going on here? My Patron
said that she looked it up on various Japanese learning sites and
they couldn't explain it at all.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">They just said you have to learn
which cases you use "もの" and which cases you use "こと".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">This isn't the case at
all.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">What "もの"really designates is a
"thing".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And a thing is a noun, so it can be
a concrete thing like an apple or a book or a universe, but it can
also be an abstract thing like love or happiness.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">These are all nouns.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So "aiは subaらしい mono だ" is the only
way you can say it, because "ai"is a "もの", not a "こと".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">It's a noun.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">It's a thing.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">It's not a state, it's not an
action, it's not a condition.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">It's a thing.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And we need to bear this in mind as
we look at some of the more extended meanings of "もの" and "こと", as
we start to see "もの" and "こと"on occasion being used as something
like sentence enders.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">But before we get to that, let's
look at some of the other extended uses of "こと".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Now, one of the most common ones is
"shita ことが ある".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">For example, we might say "nihonに
itta ことが ある".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And that means "I have been to
Japan".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And, as you see, "I have been to
Japan"is a different kind of statement from "I went to
Japan".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"I went to Japan"is referring to one
particular instance of going to Japan.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"I have been to Japan"is saying that
in the past, perhaps on one occasion, perhaps on many occasions,
going to Japan is something that I have done.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">In Japanese what we're literally
saying is "the activity, the fact, of my having been to Japan in
the past exists."Now, I had an Italian Patron at one time who took
me up on my early lesson on the Japanese tenses.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">I said that Japanese has only three
tenses.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And that's correct: Japanese has
only three tenses.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And my Italian friend asked me "So
how would I say something like 'I have been to Japan' as opposed to
'I went to Japan'?" and I explained how that is.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And he said "well, in that case,
Japanese doesn't just have three tenses.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">It's just like Italian or French or
other European languages..."It has perfective tenses and pluperfect
and all these complicated things that European languages
have.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And therefore I should be teaching
it that way.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">I should be teaching the Japanese
past and present and future and pluperfect and perfective and all
that sort of thing.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">But that is a perfect example of
what's wrong with Western Japanese teaching.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">It would be bundling Japanese,
categorizing Japanese as if it were a European language gone
wrong.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Of course any language of any
sophistication needs to be able to express just about any kind of
time relation.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">But it doesn't do it in the way that
European languages do it.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">It doesn't do it by means of
conjugating verbs.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">In fact, as I've said before,
Japanese doesn't conjugate verbs at all, even in cases that look a
bit more like it to Western eyes.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">It uses an entirely different kind
of strategy.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">It says "the fact of my having been
to Japan exists".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Now, if we go from "shita ことが ある" to
the present tense "する ことが ある", if instead of saying "nihonに itta
ことが ある", we say "nihonに iku ことが ある", we're now saying "the fact of
my going to Japan exists".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">In other words, we're saying "I
sometimes go to Japan / going to Japan is a fact that
exists".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">If we say "donna hitoに-mo shippai する
ことが ある", we're saying "everybody sometimes makes mistakes /
whatever kind of person it may be, the fact of making mistakes
exists".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Now, if you're going to start
calling these things tenses, that would have to be the
past-present-and-future-occasionally-happening tense, which is
nonsense, but then so's all the rest of it.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">It's simply the Japanese strategy
for saying that a certain category of event sometimes happens --
the fact of its happening exists.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Now, "もの"is sometimes used in ways
that really do seem like a sentence-ender.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And the first way in which this
happens is when we add "mono だ" to a complete logical
clause.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And what this means is that the
logical clause we're talking about, as a generalization, is a
reality -- it's a "もの", it's a thing, it's something we have to
contend with, it's something we have to accept.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And this is why we're using "もの"
here and not "こと".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">When we say "ことが ある", we're
literally talking about a "こと", a state of affairs, a fact that
happens, but here we're consolidating what we're talking about into
a "thing".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">It's not literally a thing, it's not
literally something you could hold in your hand, but we are using
the hyperbole of saying that it is.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">If we say "fuyuは samui mono だ" ,
what we're saying is "winter is cold, and that's just a thing,
that's a thing, you have to come to terms with it".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Someone says "Ooh, it's cold" and
you say "fuyuは samui mono だ" -- "winter IS cold / winter's a cold
thing".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Now, we can actually parse it out in
that way.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">We can make it "fuyuは samui"is a
complete sentence but we could also be saying "fuyuは samui mono だ"
- "winter is a cold thing", and this would be a complete logical
sentence.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Whether it's intended in that way or
not is not always possible to tell, and it doesn't tend to matter
because the meaning is much the same either way.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">But there are sentences when it
can't possibly be read as simply grammatical.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So, for example, we may say "kibou の
aru ところには kanarazu shirenが aru mono だ" , and what we're saying
there is "where there's hope, there's always a test", a test here
meaning something we have to overcome, something we have to do in
order to attain that hope.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Now, there's no way of tying this up
logically.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">We simply have the complete logical
sentence "kibou の aru ところに は kannarazu shirenが ある" and then we're
adding to the end of it, as a kind of sentence-ender, "mono
だ".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">It doesn't make logical sense, but
what you're doing is making that statement and then emphasizing it
and also putting a particular kind of stress on it by saying "mono
だ" - "that's just how it is, it's a thing, that's something we have
to understand, that's something we have to get used to, it's
something that doesn't change, it's something that's inevitable":
"mono だ" -- "it's a thing".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Now, interestingly, that's when we
have "mono だ" in the present; when we put it in the past it has a
different implication.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And again, this isn't some strange
rule we have to learn.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Just as with "する ことが ある"versus
"shita ことが ある", there are perfectly good reasons why it has to be
like that.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">The "mono だ" we've just discussed
has to be in the present tense because we're talking about
generalization, and the present tense, as we know, isn't really a
present tense.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">It covers the present and the
future, and it can, even though it's called the non-past tense --
it's really the indefinite tense -- it can cover the past as well
so long as it's also covering the present and the
future.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So it's a generalization tense in
this case.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">But when we say it in the past it
has a different meaning.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">If we say "子供 の koroに は yoku
kochiraに kita mono だ" , what we're saying is "when I was a child I
often used to come to this place.""Mono だ" here is referring to
something in the past.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And what it's saying is that in the
past it was a thing.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And it has a kind of personal
implication.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"It's a thing, it's a thing I think
about, it's a thing I remember / to me, those past memories are a
thing, they're a reality."So again, we're using this "もの"for
something which is essentially abstract.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">What's the difference between saying
"tokyoに itta mono だ" and "tokyoに itta ことが ある"? The "ことが ある" is
simply a literal statement: "the fact of my having been to Tokyo
exists."" tokyoに itta mono だ" is in English like saying "I used to
go to Tokyo" and it has much more emotional weight.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">It's like saying "this is a thing I
used to do, this is something that used to happen".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And you see we concretize it by
figuratively calling it "a thing": it was a "もの", it was a thing,
it was something that used to happen.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Now, I'm not going to go into
sentences that top off a logical clause with "to iu こと"or "to iu
mono", because that would take us into the extended meanings of "to
iu" and the quotation function, which is a whole other
area.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">But I am going to talk briefly about
a place where we see "こと"used on its own as something like a
sentence-ender.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">We see a logical clause followed by
"こと".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And people sometimes say that this
marks an order, but that's not exactly correct.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">What it marks is a rule or a
regulation.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And that's an important
distinction.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">You'll see why in a
minute.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So, if you're going to a dojo and
see a list of rules pinned to the wall, it may be numbered and it
may say "ichi naninani こと, ni naninani こと, san naninani こと", and
that's really like saying "Rule 1: naninani, Rule 2: naninani",
etc.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">You might go into one of those
Penguin Cafés where the waiters and waitresses are all penguins and
you may see a sign saying "pengin を kusuguranai こと" and that means
"Don't tickle the penguins".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And the reason it's marked with "こと"
is because this is a rule of the establishment.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">If you go into that café, you are
duty bound not to tickle the penguins, ever, however tempting it
may be, because it's a "こと".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And what is a "こと"? In this case
it's a decision which also means a rule or a regulation.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">I've made a video before about the
expressions "ことに なる" and "ことに する".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">When you put "ことに する"on the end of a
logical clause, we're saying that one has "decided to do" the
action of that logical clause.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">When we have "ことに なる", it means that
the action of that logical clause has been decided upon.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And we have to put that passively in
English, because there's no other way of translating it into
English, but it's not passive in Japanese.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">As we know, Japanese has no
passive.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So, this is the same "こと" -- "a
decided thing".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And in Japanese, this also implies a
rule or a regulation.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">One of the commonest words for a
rule or regulation in Japanese is a "kimari".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Now, "kimari"is the い-stem, the
noun-form of the verb "kimaru".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And "kimaru"is the self-move version
of the pair "kimeru / kimaru".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Kimeru" means to "decide something"
and "kimaru" means "something has been decided".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And once again, we're forced to put
it passively in English although it's not passive in
Japanese.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And I've made a video about this
whole passivity problem that English has with Japanese.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So if you want to pursue that
further, I suggest you watch that video.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So, a "こと" is the same as a
"kimari": "a decided thing / a rule / a regulation".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And when it's put on to the end of a
logical clause, it simply marks that logical clause as a rule or a
regulation.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">If you have any questions or
comments, please put them in the Comments below and I will answer
as usual.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">I'd like to thank my Gold Kokeshi

<h1 class="c15" id="h.k20meyhe3nvu"><span class="c18">Lesson 65:
Coming and Going: Deeper secrets of 行く and 来る、て行くand て来る (te-iku,
teくru)</span></h1>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">こんにちは.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Today we're going to talk about
coming and going in Japanese.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Now, "行く" and "kuru" are two of the
first words we learn when we start learning Japanese, and we learn
that they mean "come" and "go", and broadly they do.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">But as we become more advanced we
understand that it isn't quite that simple.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">They have many metaphorical and more
subtle meanings, but even the physical meaning doesn't correspond
exactly to English "come" and "go".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Essentially, "行く" means "go from
where the speaker is to somewhere else", and "kuru" means "come
from somewhere else to where the speaker is".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Isn't that just the same as English
"come" and "go"? Well, not quite.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">For example, we can say to someone
on the phone "Shall I come over to see you?"or you might say "will
you come to me, or shall I come to you?" and in Japanese that's
quite impossible, because you can't "come" to a place where you
aren't.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Coming" means coming from somewhere
where the speaker is not to the place where thespeaker
is.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So you can't say to someone on the
telephone "Shall I come to you?" with "kuru".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">You can only say "Shall I go to
you?" with "行く".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Shall I go to you?" would sound
strange in English, so we see that "kuru" and "行く" aren't exactly
interchangeable with English "come" and "go".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Kuru"can only ever mean "move from
where the speaker isn't to where the speaker is".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">" 行く"is not quite so
strict.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">We can talk about someone "行く"-ing
from A to B when we are actually at C, but "kuru"must always mean
movement toward C, the place where we are.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And this is important to understand
as we get into the more metaphorical meanings of "kuru" and
"行く".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">We've talked about some of the
extended meanings in an earlier lesson but still physical ones,
especially those which involve connecting "kuru"or "行く" to the
て-form of a verb.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So "motte kuru" means "bring (to the
place where I am)" ; "motte 行く" means "take (from the place where I
am)".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">But "the place where I am"can
actually be a time or it can actually be a mental state of
identification.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So we get more advanced meanings
which are all based on the fundamental physical metaphor of coming
to the place where one is, going from the place where one is, or
going from or going one place to another (but not coming from one
place to another because that isn't possible).</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So, a very simple example is we may
say "雨が futte kita"-- and we have almost an equivalent English
expression: we might say "It came on to rain".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And the metaphor here is a time
metaphor.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Rain came towards us in time, from a
time when it wasn't there to the time where we are, when the rain
is there.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">If we say "dandan ame が futte 行く",
we're saying "It's getting rainier and rainier" and we're
projecting into the future.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">" 行く"is moving from where we are
into the future.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Now, since time, at least
apparently, moves forward, we can only use "行く"in the sense of
moving forward in time, away from us, away from the point where we
are, not moving backward in time away from the point where we are,
because that isn't currently possible.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So, "雨が futte 行く"in this case
implies that it has become rainy ("futte kita") and that it's
increasingly going to do so in the future.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Now, we can also use "kuru" and
"行く"in subtler ways still, concerned not with space or time but
with subjectivity, with our mental state.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So, a very common expression is
"wakatte kuru", which in English might be rendered as "come to
understand", but this of course would be wrong.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Let's take an example of
why.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">We might say "勉強 sureba, dandan
suugakuが wakatte kuru".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And that would be translated
normally as "if you study, you will come to understand
mathematics".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And as you can see, if you've been
paying attention, there's a contradiction here.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">You can't come to a place where you
aren't yet in Japanese.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">You can't use "kuru" to speak about
coming to somewhere that you aren't at this stage but will be in
the future.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">It would have to be "行く", wouldn't
it? So why is "kuru"used here? Well, if you've followed this course
you probably know the answer already.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">" 分かる"does not mean
"understand".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">It means "be understandable / be
clear"or literally what it actually means is "do
understandable".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So what we're in fact saying is that
if you study, math will come to be understandable to
you.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">In other words, math will come from
being far from you to being nearer to you and being
understandable.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So we're using this in a subjective
sense.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And this is an important thing to
understand, and it's important to understand that "kuru" and
"行く"can represent movement in time, toward one or away from one,
movement in space, toward one or away from one, movement in
subjectivity, towards one's mental condition or state or away from
it, but also "行く"can represent objectivity versus
"kuru"representing subjectivity.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And the reason for this is something
we've already covered, which is that "行く"can mean moving from A to
B while we are at C.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Therefore, "行く"can represent a
movement from one place to another that doesn't involve us,
physically, temporally, or mentally or emotionally.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So, if we say "samuku natte kita"
we're saying "it became cold", and adding that "kita" ("kuru") is
relating it to us: "It became cold (coming toward me or us)."So
what we're saying is not just that it became cold, but implying
that it affects me or us subjectively: "Samuku natte
kita".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">By contrast, "samuku natte itta"is
more objective.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">It doesn't involve us.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">It doesn't imply that it in any way
affected me or us.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">It just happened.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">It became colder.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Because this is the "itta" that in
spatial terms is going from A to B, objectively, without involving
me or us.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Now, you may be asking, " how do I
tell when it's movement in space, when it's movement in time, when
it's movement in terms of mentality and subjectivity, and when
"kuru" and "行く"represent subjectivity versus objectivity?" and the
answer to that is: There aren't any rules and we shouldn't be
looking for rules in cases like this.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">The reason we learn the ways that
these work is not as an end in itself, not as a set of facts to
learn, but as an aid to understanding real Japanese.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">As we immerse in Japanese, as we
watch anime, read novels, play games in Japanese, these things
start to make sense.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">What we need is the principles on
which they're based, which gives us a head start in making sense of
them.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">But structure is never going to
substitute for immersion.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Structure is the underpinning that
makes immersion quicker, and easier, and more
understandable.</span></p>

<h1 class="c15" id="h.1vovfob2gpl9"><span class="c18">Lesson 66:
HIDDEN Subjects in Japanese - and how to understand
them</span></h1>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">こんにちは.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Today we're going to talk about the
" hidden hand"in Japanese.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">What do I mean by that? Well, a
number of people claim that Japanese has no subject.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And I think we've established beyond
any doubt that Japanese not only has a subject but that you can't
have any Japanese sentence without a subject, although you can't
always see or hear the subject.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">It can be a
"zero-pronoun".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">By subject, of course, I mean the
A-car of a sentence.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And since every sentence is telling
us either that "a is B"or that "a does B", obviously we can't have
a sentence without A.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">It's as simple as that.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">However, there are times when not
only can't we see the subject, the A-car, but it can be difficult
to work out what exactly it is.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And this difficulty will be seen to
derive from not fully understanding how some aspects of Japanese
work.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">One thing we need to understand is
that different languages have different
expression-strategies.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">We know already how damaging it is
to say that "コーヒーが 好き だ" means "I like coffee".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"I like coffee"is what we would say
in English, but English uses an entirely different
expression-strategy from Japanese.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Liking is expressed by a verb, and
the doer of the verb is the person who likes the coffee.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">In Japanese, liking is expressed by
an adjectival noun, and the be-er of that adjectival noun is the
coffee.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So the Japanese expression-strategy
here is closer to the Spanish than the English, although they're
not identical.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Now, although languages have
differing expression-strategies, it turns out that languages, even
when they're not related, tend to have a relatively limited bag of
tricks that they draw on.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So we find the same
expression-strategies in different languages, but not necessarily
in the same places.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And also expression-strategies can
vary in status between languages.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So, one of the reasons that English
so-called Japanese grammar misnames the Japanese receptive
helper-verb as a passive conjugation or passive voice, is that what
it really is, while it exists in English, is not of very high
status.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Because we use the receptive in
English by using the word "got"under various circumstances like "I
got rescued by my big sister", "the sandwiches got eaten by the
dog"-- but this isn't considered good English.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Now, the fact that it isn't
considered good English is simply a matter of fashion.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">It's perfectly
grammatical.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">It just happens to be unfashionable
or to hold low status in the language.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">This is really just a historical
accident.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Now similarly, other
expression-strategies exist in Japanese that are not considered of
very high status in English and that can confuse us.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So, I'm going to take a sentence
here which was put to me by one of my viewers, who had considerable
difficulty in disentangling what the subject of this sentence
actually is.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And that's perfectly understandable,
because until you understand this expression-strategy, it's not
entirely clear.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Now, the sentence comes from NHK
News Easy, which is a very good news service for beginners in
Japanese.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And the sentence is: "toukyou
orinpikku senshuが 食べる ryouri を minnaに oshiete morau."So, what do we
think is the subject, the A-car, of this sentence? Now, the first
thing to do when analyzing a sentence is what I said in my video on
sentence analysis, which is that we need to see where logical
clauses end within a sentence.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">A logical clause which is
functioning as a logical clause and not a descriptor or a helper to
anything else can only end in two ways, either with a full stop,
making it the end of a sentence, or with a conjunction, marking it
as the first logical clause within a compound sentence.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Of course, if it comes at the end of
a sentence it may be followed by one or more sentence-ender
particles, but it has to be the final engine in the sentence: the
final verb, noun-plus-copula or adjective.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So let's go through this in the
manner that I've taught you in the past.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">" toukyou orinpikku senshuが
食べる..."Is that a logical clause? Well, it could be a logical
clause, couldn't it? It would mean "the Tokyo Olympic athletes
eat." however, is it followed by a full stop, by sentence-ender
particles with a full stop, or does it end in some kind of a clause
connector like からor "でも" or the て-form or the い-stem of a verb? No,
it doesn't end with any of those, does it? It's directly followed
by a noun.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And, as we know, when a logical
clause is directly followed by a noun, what it's doing is modifying
that noun.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">In other words, it's not functioning
as an active logical clause; it's functioning as, essentially, an
adjective, a noun-modifier.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So "toukyou orinpikku senshuが 食べる"
is all simply modifying "ryouri".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">It's just telling us more about the
food.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So then we have: "...ryouri を minnaに
oshiete morau."Now, we still haven't arrived at the subject of the
sentence, have we? Because the subject of any sentence has to be
marked with が.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">The "senshu" are marked with が, but
we know they're not the subject of the sentence; they're just
helping to modify "ryouri".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Ryouri"can't be the subject of the
sentence because it's marked with を, not が.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Minna"can't be the subject of the
sentence because it's marked with に, not が.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So what is going on here? Well, what
is the sentence actually saying? It's saying that someone, the
subject of the sentence, whoever that may be, is having everyone
teach or advise them about the food the Olympic athletes are to
eat.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Now, my questioner actually got this
far, but then was stumped by the question of who this unnamed
person or people might be.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Could it be the athletes? Well, that
isn't likely, and we always have to consider likelihood in
resolving any kind of ambiguity.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">This isn't really an ambiguous
sentence but the context makes it pretty clear that it's not the
athletes.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">First of all, by default these "て
morau"sentences mean that somebody actively had someone else do
something.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So the person doing "morau"is
getting the person doing the て-formed verb to do that て-formed
verb.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So if we say "o-isha-sanに mite
morau", we're saying " have the doctor look at me".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So someone is having everybody teach
them or give their opinions on what the athletes should
eat.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Is this likely to be the athletes?
Well, not really.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Are they likely to be getting
together and asking everybody what they should eat? So who is it?
Who is the が marked zero-pronoun, the subject, the A-car of this
sentence? And the answer is, it is simply an undefined
zero-pronoun.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Now, that might seem very strange,
but in fact it isn't.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">As a matter of fact, we use it all
the time in English.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">But you would never see it in a
newspaper or a news service the way it is here, which is what's
confusing about it.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So when do we use an undefined
pronoun like this? Well, let's think about it.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Suppose someone said "I hear they're
putting a man on Mars next year." well, who's "they"? Well, we
don't know who "they"is.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Presumably whoever it is that puts
men on Mars -- NASA or Mr.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Musk, or somebody.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Now, suppose I say "they're getting
everyone's opinion on what the Olympic athletes should eat." well
again, somebody might well say that in English.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">You wouldn't see it in the
newspaper, but a friend might well say it to you: "You know,
they're getting everybody's opinion on what the Olympic athletes
should eat." who's "they"? Well, we don't really know.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Whoever it is that's responsible for
feeding the Olympic athletes, presumably.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And this is a construction that
you'll see quite often in Japanese, this unnamed "they", whoever
they might be.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">You hear it in English all the time
but it's of low status.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">You won't see it in official
documents or newspapers or anything like that.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">You only hear it in relatively
casual speech.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">In French you might hear it more
often.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"On" (they, one) can be used more
generically at a higher level of discourse than it can in
English.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So once we know this, it's easy
enough to pinpoint the subject of this sentence.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And it's an important thing to know
because we're going to come across this kind of construction
relatively often in Japanese.</span></p>

comments, please put them in the Comments below and I will answer
as usual.</span></p>

and まだ the time-relations that make sense of them (mou and
mada)</span></h1>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">こんにちは.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Today we're going to talk about
"mou" and "mada", two expressions which can be a little confusing,
particularly "mou".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">If we look up "mou"in a Japanese と
-English dictionary, we get told that it means "now, already, soon,
before long" and sometimes even "not any more", as well as meaning
"another" and being an expression of anno や nce.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">How can it mean all these different
time relations at the same time? Well, we're going to find out
today.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And we're going to see that it's not
nearly as confusing as it looks.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">But first of all I want to look at
"mada", which is a bit less confusing but will give us the
principles we need for understanding how "mou"really
works.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">All right.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So, "mada" has a less confusing
collection of definitions.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Mostly we're told that it means
either "still"or "not yet".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So let's start by looking at what it
really does mean, what it really does.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Mada"does a number of
things.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">It tells us about the present
time.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">It situates the present time inside
a time segment that stretches back into the past and is either
expected to end or at least the possibility of its ending is being
considered.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Most often it's expected to
end.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Now, this does three
things.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">It tells us about the present, so we
can say that it is in fact a way of saying "now", but "now"in a
particular relation to the past and the future.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">What is that relation? Well, as you
see, we have two things.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">We have the section of time in which
"now"lies and we have a transition point.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Since it's a section of time, it
can't go on for ever, so there's a transition point at which it
changes to another section of time with other qualities that is
expected in the future or at least considered as a possibility in
the future.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Now, "mada"gives us two
contrasts.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">The section of time is contrasted
with the future when it will or may change, but the present moment
is contrasted with the past when it might have been expected to
change.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So what this means in English is
essentially "still".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And this may seem a bit abstract,
but I think we'll understand it clearly enough when we see how it
works.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So, if we say "shukudaiは mada
shiなかった", we're saying "I haven't done my homework yet"or "I still
haven't done my homework."Now, as you see, this means that we are
in a section of time where I haven't done my homework.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">This stretches back into the past
and is contrasted with a period in the future where I will have
done my homework.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">But the present time is being
contrasted with a time in the past where I might have or should
have done my homework.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">That's why we say "mada" and that's
why in English we would say "still"or " haven't yet".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">In other words, there's a time in
the past where it might have been expected to happen, but it
hasn't.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So it's still in a state which won't
change until the future.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And this is what we mean by terms
like "still" and "yet"in English.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">If we say "Sakuraは mada w赤い" , we're
saying "Sakura is still young."Now again, what we're saying is that
the present time is situated in a period where Sakura is young,
that period stretches back into the past and is expected to change
at some time in the future.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">She won't be young forever, she'll
get older.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So we can see that the time period
while Sakura is young is contrasted with the future when she will
get older.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">But the present moment is being
contrasted with the past.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">That's why we say "mada"or why in
English we would say "still".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">What we're saying is "She hasn't
stopped being young yet".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">As opposed to the possibility that
she stopped being young in the past, she hasn't stopped being young
in the past -- she's still young now, even though she won't be
young in the future.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">If we say "Sakuraは mada otona deは
nai", we're saying "Sakura is not yet grown-up".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So now we're using the negative, and
that's why "mada"can mean "still"or "not yet".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">It just depends, at least in this
case, on the fact that it's being used with a negative.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So, if we say "Sakuraは mada otona
deは nai", we're saying that at the present period Sakura isn't
grown-up.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Even though you might have thought
she'd grown up a little while ago, she hasn't.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">But of course she will grow up in
the future.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">As you can see, the reason why it
gets translated both as "still" and "not yet"is because Japanese
puts things a little bit differently from English.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">In English we say "Sakura is not yet
grown-up".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">But in Japanese what we actually say
is "Sakura is still not grown up".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">However, for "mada" to mean "not
yet" we don't have to have an explicit negative.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">For example, if someone says to you
"日本語は umai ne" -- "Your Japanese is very good, isn't it?" well,
Japanese people tend to say that even if you can stagger out
"Koにchiは ".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And even if your Japanese really is
very good, you'll probably reply "ie mada mada です".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Mada mada"in this case means "not
yet".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">In other words, we're still in the
time period where my Japanese isn't good.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">The change didn't take place in the
past, as you are saying; it will have to take place in the
future.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And just a little cultural note: In
the West it can sometimes be considered a bit rude to contradict
someone who's said something nice to you, but in Japanese we do
that all the time.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">It's considered a bit arrogant not
to.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Now, let's move on to "mou", where
we get a few more apparent complications, but they aren't really
complications, as we're going to see.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Mou"is essentially the opposite of
"mada".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">The best translation for it in
English is that it means "already".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">What it means is that we are now in
a time segment stretching forward into the future.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So, just the other way around from
"mada".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">The time segment is compared to the
past when the current conditions didn't prevail and now is compared
to the future when the transition might have been expected to
happen, but in fact it's already happened.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So if someone says "shukudai を
shi-nasai" ("Do your homework!"), you might reply "Mou や tta yo"
("I already did it").</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So what we're saying is we are now
in the time segment where my homework is done, I've done it, and
the transition isn't going to happen in the future, as you might
think; It's already happened in the past.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So why is it sometimes translated as
having different meanings from "already", such as "now"? Well, as
we've seen, both "mada" ("still") and "mou" (" already") are in
fact species of "now".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">We're talking about now.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">We're just making different
contrasts with the past and the future when we talk about
now.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So, of course, "mou"does mean "now",
just as "already"does.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">But because words in different
languages very rarely occupy exactly the same stretch of the
meaning spectrum, sometimes we use "mou"in places where we would
use "now"in English.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And because J-E dictionaries are
Anglocentric they will try to translate "mou" as meaning "now"in
those cases.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So, for example, if you've hurt
yourself and you're getting up and somebody says "Daijoubu?" and
you reply "Mou daijoubu", how you would translate this into English
is usually "I'm all right now".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">In English you wouldn't usually say
"I'm already all right".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Now, in Japanese you could also say
"Ima daijoubu", which also means "I'm all right now", but when you
say "mou daijoubu"you're specifically adding the nuance that, while
you weren't all right before, you are now, as opposed to at some
time in the near future, all right.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">In other words, you don't need any
more time to recover, you're okay.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">In English, we don't use
"already"for that.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Logically we could, but in practice
we usually don't.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Now, it's perfectly true to say that
"mou"is also used as an expression of anno や nce or exasperation:
"Mou!" and it compresses all kinds of complaints or grumbles, or it
can just be on its own: "Mou!" how does that work? Interestingly,
"already"can in some circumstances have a little bit of that kind
of nuance in English.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So, if someone says "Enough
already!" what they mean is, at this point, as opposed to at some
point in the future, I'm fed up with it.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And that's really what "Mou!" tends
to mean in Japanese.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So that's really simple
enough.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">However, there is one aspect of
"mou" which is a tiny bit confusing until you understand it, and
that is that there are really two words "mou".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Now, this may be a little bit
controversial, but in fact in pitch-accent dictionaries they're
actually given two different accentuations, one for the "mou" that
we've been talking about, the one that means "already", and one for
another "mou", which is quite close in many respects and I'll
explain why it's quite close later.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">But first of all let's look at the
area where it isn't so close.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">This second "mou", I think, is
ultimately related to the particle "も" and it has the same additive
kind of meaning of "another".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So if we say "mou 一つ", we're saying
"another one".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">If we're saying "mou hitori", we're
saying "another person".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So, when we put it like that, we can
see we're really dealing with two separate words, two separate
concepts.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Now, it then becomes a little bit
more confusing, and I'm going to tell you why.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">It even confuses Japanese people,
who actually don't do this pitch accent thing right in many cases,
because the idea that they are two different words often gets
rather lost even by Japanese natives.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And the reason for that is that
there are many cases where they get pretty close.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Why? Well, as we've seen, "mou"
tells us about a time relation, it's a time-related word, and it
means "already".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And also the dictionaries tell us
that it means "soon".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Why do they say that it means
"soon"? Well, it doesn't mean soon on its own, but it means
"soon"in certain combinations.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So, for example, if we say "mou
sugu", which means "soon", what we're really saying is: "sugu"
means "soon" and "mou" means "already", so that "mou"is emphasizing
the "soon": it's already soon, it's not going to be soon at some
point in the future, it's soon right now.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Now, we can also say "mou
sukoshi".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">For example, if some people are
walking somewhere and they've been walking for a long time and
they're getting tired, someone might say "mou sukoshi!" which means
"just a little more / just a little extra".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And it could mean "just a little
more effort", but it can also mean "just a little more
time".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So, you see, "mou sugu" and "mou
sukoshi", even though they're different words "mou", under some
circumstances have a very similar meaning.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And the other "mou", the additive
"mou", also is often used to express time relation.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So if we say "mou ichido", we're
saying "one more time".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Now obviously this means very much
the same as it means when we say "mou 一つ", which means "one more
thing"-- one more candy, one more anything.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">But it also is very often used with
"ichido": one more time.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Mou nido konai" means "I'll never
come again", literally "I won't come for another second
time".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So we can see that the two "mou"s
tread fairly closely toward the same territory.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">They can both be used for time
relations and in a few contexts, like "mou sukoshi" and "mou sugu",
the meaning is almost identical.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">But once we understand the two and
how they work, I don't think there's going to be any more room for
confusion.</span></p>

<h1 class="c15" id="h.z4xjwh778qx1"><span class="c18">Lesson 68:
Japanese "underlying logic": わけ、そういうわけ、わけが分からない、わけない</span></h1>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">こんにちは.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Today we're going to talk about
"wake", which is a Japanese word that can cause quite a lot of
confusion because it's used in a variety of different ways and
situations in Japanese and in English dictionaries it has a whole
string of definitions that seem particularly disjointed and
confusing.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">However, once we understand the real
logic, the underlying meaning of the word, it all falls into place
rather nicely.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So, what is "wake"? First of all,
let's look at the English dictionary definition.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">In the online dictionary it says
"wake" means "conclusion from reasoning; judgement or calculation
based on something read or heard; reason; cause; meaning;
circumstances; situation".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So, what does it actually mean out
of all that? Well, for a nice change the dictionary actually agrees
that it's a noun.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">" wake"is a noun, so what kind of a
noun is it? What is a "wake"? Well, let's look a bit at the history
of the word.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Originally, "wake"meant "divide or
separate".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So it's connected with "wakeru",
which is a verb meaning "divide or separate", and also, more
importantly for our present purposes, "分かる", which also
fundamentally means "divide or separate" but in the sense of "break
down, or analyze".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So, when we say "本が 分かる", as I've
pointed out in previous lessons, we're not in fact saying "I
understand the book"; we're saying "the book does understandable or
does clear".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">We could say in English "the book is
clear to me", but in fact it's not an adjective, it's a verb --
"the book does clear (to me)".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">But when we say "clear" we are using
slightly the wrong metaphor if we want to go into the actual
etymology of the word.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Clear"is a metaphor, obviously,
from seeing.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">But the real metaphor that underlies
"分かる" is being broken down into constituent parts, being analyzed
or analyzable.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And that's what "wake" means
here.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Now I know some of you may be
thinking "but it's a different kanji".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Well, that's true.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">We usually associate "分かる" with this
kanji, but in fact you can write the word "分かる" with three
different possible kanji and they all have slightly different
implications -- and I've written an article about that if you're
interested, so I'll put a link in the information section
below.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">The point is that "wake / 分かる" is
not tied to any one kanji.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">It's a fundamental Japanese word
that goes back further than the kanji used to represent it, and the
fundamental idea in all these cases is the same: the idea of
separation, division, analysis, breakdown.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So, what actually is a "wake"? Let's
take the most prominent English definitions, which are: cause,
reason, and conclusion based on something we've seen or
heard.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Now, let's note that cause, reason,
and conclusion generally speaking refer to the same
thing.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">The main difference is whether the
process is going backward or whether the process is going
forward.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Let's take an example.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">If I say "Sakura was out in the
rain, and therefore she's wet", we are taking two known facts and
stating the causal, the reasoning, connection between the
two.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">If I say "Sakura is wet and
therefore I reason that she was out in the rain", we're taking
exactly the same piece of reason, the same causality, and working
in the other direction.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">We're working from one known fact to
another unknown fact that we use the reasoning to arrive
at.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">But that piece of reasoning, that
causal link, that fundamental underlying reasonality, is the same
in both statements.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">In one case we're working it
forward, in the other case we're working it backward, but that
fundamental underlying causal logical reasonality, to coin a
phrase, is the same.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And I coined the phrase
"reasonality" because there isn't really a word for this in
English.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">But in Japanese there is, and the
word is "wake".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So "wake", as we see, expresses a
cause, a reason, and a conclusion or a logical judgement -- all of
those things.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">What it really expresses is the
underlying causality or reasonality, and when the dictionaries say
that it also expresses a circumstance or situation or something
like that, in fact it doesn't really do that, but what it does is
express the underlying reasonality of a circumstance or a
situation.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And once we understand that, we can
start to understand the different ways in which "wake"is
used.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So, it's used to give a
reason.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So, if someone says "sou iu wake de
beddo の shitaに kakureta" -- "that's why I was hiding under the
bed"-- that's the reason.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">If we find out the solution to what
seemed like an impossible crime, we say, "sou iu wake でした" -- "so
that's how it happened".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And we're not actually talking about
the fact of the crime, the circumstance of the crime, the situation
of the crime; we're talking about the reasonality that at first
seemed completely obscure and now we've understood.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And if you notice, in this phrase we
say "sou iu wake でした", in the past tense.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">It's not because my reasoning
happened in the past.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">My reasoning might be happening
right now.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">But it's because the underlying
reasonality of the event happened at the time of the event, and
that's what we're talking about.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">If we say "sonna wake de shukudai を
wasureました", we're saying "that's why I forgot my homework", that's
the reason, the causal link that tells us why it was that I forgot
my homework and why you shouldn't blame me.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Now, "wake"is used in a lot of
negative uses that are very important in Japanese.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">One that you'll commonly hear is
"wake が wakaranai".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Now, that's very puzzling if we
don't know what "wake" means and we also, as is the case if you
take the textbooks seriously, don't know what "分かる"
means.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">" 分かる", as we know, doesn't mean
"understand"; it means "do clear"or, if we take the most literal
sense of the word, "do broken down / do analyzed".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So what we're actually saying here
is that the reasoning, the underlying reasonality of something
"doesn't do analyzed".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">The way AI entities like myself
would tend to put it is "the reasoning behind that does not
compute".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">In other words, it's meaningless,
it's nonsense.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">In other negative uses, "wake"is
often used to mean "it's not as if...</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">/ it's not that..."or "it doesn't
mean that..." and of course, all those in fact fundamentally break
down to the same thing.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">We take sentence A and then we're
saying that sentence B conclusion can't be drawn from
it.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So if we say, for example, that she
always eats in cheap restaurants and then add "okane が tarinai wake
deは nai", we're saying "it isn't that she's short of money"or "it's
not as if she's short of money".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">What we're saying here is that the
conclusion from the fact that she always eats in cheap restaurants
isn't that she's short of money; she isn't short of
money.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Someone might say, "shitto shita
wake deは ariません" -- "it's not that I got jealous".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Again, "don't draw from my actions
or words the conclusion that I got jealous.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">That's not what it was".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And, essentially, the dictionaries
here say that "wake" means a situation or a circumstance because
they take these statements as being denying the situation or the
circumstance, but as you see, that's not exactly what they're
doing.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">They're not denying the situation or
the circumstance, they're denying the underlying reasonality of the
situation or the circumstance, and in doing that also implicitly
denying the situation or the circumstance, but that isn't always
the case.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">For example, we might say "Just
because she's fat doesn't mean she eats too much" -- "食べ すぎる wake
deは nai", the reasonality isn't that she eats too much.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And we may not be saying that she
doesn't eat too much.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">We're just saying that the fact that
she's fat doesn't necessarily mean that she eats too much, that's
not good reasoning.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">We don't know whether that's true or
not, but from the fact that she's fat we can't say that.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So, what we're doing in all these
cases is denying a certain rational connection.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">We're saying that that rational
connection doesn't exist.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Whether the fact that it implies
exists or not isn't really what we're talking about
here.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">In some cases we're implying that it
doesn't, in some cases we may not be implying anything either
way.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">But the important thing that we're
denying is the underlying reasonality, the logical link that might
be made in these cases.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Now, another common negative use is
"wake が ない" , sometimes shortened to just "wake nai".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">This tends to be strongly denying
that something exists at all.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Again one might think one is denying
the situation or the circumstance, but what one is denying is the
rationality of it.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Now, how do we tell this from the
uses that we saw before? Well, let's notice the structural
difference.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">One is "x wake deは nai", that's to
say that the circumstance we've talked about or are referring to
doesn't have that reasoning.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">This is the simple difference
between "deは nai" and "ga nai" that we talked about way back in our
lesson on negatives.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So, in these cases where we're
saying "it doesn't mean that...</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">/ it's not that...</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">/ it's not as if..."etc, in other
words "that reasoning doesn't apply", here we're saying that no
reasoning exists.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">" wake が ない" : "there is no
reasoning".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And therefore, since there is no
reasoning, since it doesn't compute, it can't be the
case.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So, for example, "Sakuraは uso を
tsuku wake が ない" -- "Sakura wouldn't tell a lie"-- there's no way
she'd tell a lie.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">The underlying logic or reasonality
of Sakura telling a lie doesn't exist, therefore it's not possible
that she would tell a lie.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Again, "Sakura を wasureru wake が ない"
-- "I won't forget Sakura"or "I won't forget you,
Sakura".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">What we're saying here really is
that the underlying reasonality of forgetting Sakura doesn't
exist.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">There is no reasonality, it doesn't
compute, therefore it can't happen.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Now, there is another possible
meaning for "wake が ない" and that is in a more direct and literal
sense saying simply "there's no reason".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">It's not to say it's not happening
or it doesn't exist, but there's no reason for it.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So, for example, "sonnaに okane の いる
wake が ない" -- "there's no reason she would need that much money"--
she might be asking for it, she might get it, but there's really no
reason why she would need it.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">How do we know the difference
between these two? Well, this is a matter of context, and I've done
a video on how we deal with this kind of thing.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">We actually do it in English all the
time.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Lots of statements have more than
one possible interpretation and most of the time we're not aware of
it because we are so used to using the context to determine which
of a possible range of meanings is to be applied in a given
case.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">We're not conscious of this process
so we really need to understand it in order to apply it in Japanese
or any other language.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So take a look at that video if you
haven't seen it already.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And that might be particularly
useful, because there is a third use of this negative "wake が ない" ,
often reduced to just "wake nai", which is to say that something is
simple or easy.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"日本語 を 話す-noは wake が nai こと だ" --
"Speaking Japanese is easy, no problem." why do we say "wake が ない"
here? What we're saying is that there's really no reasoning
needed.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">It can be compared to the English
expression "no-brainer".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">You might think that meant that
something was stupid, but what it actually means is that something
is so easy or so obvious that it doesn't take any brainwork to
arrive at it.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And this is the use of "wake nai"
here.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"It's a no-brainer.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Talking Japanese is just
simple.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">A cakewalk.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Easy-peasy lemon-squeezy." and
again, there's not much chance of misunderstanding or confusing the
different uses provided you understand the basic rules of
disambiguation.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And provided that most of the time
you're doing it in context, in real Japanese immersion, and not in
chopped-off bleeding sample sentences.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So don't forget: structure is the
key to immersion but immersion is the key to Japanese.</span></p>

Japanese in the Wild! Tackling native Japanese material. Kaidan
4</span></h1>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">こんにちは.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Today we're going to go back to the
kaidan, the scary Japanese story that we started a few episodes
ago, so that we can tackle some more of the challenges of reading
real native Japanese.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">I've gathered all these episodes
together in one playlist, so you can look at the whole kaidan in
one place, and I'm putting that in a link just above my head right
here.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Now, to recap the story so far, our
heroine went to a drinking party at her senpai's apartment and,
walking home late at night, she discovered that she'd left her けいたい
(her portable telephone) in Senpai's apartment.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So, she went back, knocked on the
door, and there was no answer.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">She tried the handle and the door
was unlocked, so she walked in.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And it was completely dark in there,
so she assumed that Senpai had gone to bed already.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">She thought of putting the lights on
and waking her, but remembering that she'd been pretty drunk at the
time when she left she decided not to.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">She groped around in the dark to
find her けいたい and then left.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And that's the story so
far.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So let's see what happened the next
day.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Yokujitsu"-- that means "next
day".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">This word "yoku"-- as you see, the
kanji is feathers or wings and the kanji for stand.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So we could say that it was the day
standing in the wings waiting to come on stage, which it now
has.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Yokujitsu"-- The next day --
"kanojoは senpai の apaato の mae を toorikakaru to..."So we have the
first logical clause here and we have a "to" which is the if/when
conditional.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So something's going to follow it,
but let's just look at this first one: "toorikakaru" means
literally "pass hang", but what it means, what the Japanese
dictionaries say is that it means "choudo その bashoに 通る", which
means really "just happened to be passing that particular
place".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So she didn't go there for any
purpose, she just happened to be passing by.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Nazeka oozei の keikanが atsumatte
いる" -- "oozei" means a large number, a crowd -- it refers to people
-- "keikan", as I'm sure you know, is a policeman.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So, "nazeka..." ("nazeka" -- "for
some reason") a lot of policeman were gathered -- "atsumatte
いる".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">" atsumaru"is "gather" ; "atsumate
いる" -- "exist in a state of being gathered".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">A lot of policemen were
gathered.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Jijou を kiite kanojoは
驚いた.""Jijou"is "the situation or circumstances".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">In English we'd probably say "She
asked what was going on".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And "驚いた"usually gets translated as
"be surprised" but it can be stronger than that, and we can see
that it's stronger than that in this case.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">When she asked the situation, she
was startled or shocked.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And the "kanojoは " here also throws
emphasis onto that "驚いた", and we're going to talk about that in a
video in the near future, this emphasizing quality of は
.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">When she asked the situation, she
was startled or shocked by what she heard.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Nanto...</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">--- "what! / What's this?""Nanto ano
senpaiが he や で korosareta to iu no だ" -- "that senpai, in that
apartment, received the action of being killed." and this is the
receptive, isn't it? She received the action "being
killed".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">" to iu no だ" : "to iu"-- that's
what she was told, that's what was said; "no だ" -- now, we've
talked about these "n da/ no だ" endings in another
video.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So this is really saying, "It was
that senpai had, in that room, received the action of being
killed." that's what it was; that was what was going on.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">When she asked about the situation,
it was that the senpai had been killed in that room.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">" he や は arasarete ori": "arasu"is
"storm or violate or mess up".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So, the room received the action of
being messed up or violated.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And the helper receptive verb is in
て-form and followed by "ori".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Now, "oru"-- as we talked about in a
previous episode in this series, "oru"is a literary, slightly
old-fashioned way of saying "いる".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So "arasarete oru"is the same as
"arasarete いる": "was in a state of having received being violated
or messed up".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And then that "oru"is put into its
い-stem, "ori", which again, as we discussed before, is a slightly
more literary way of joining two clauses in a compound
sentence.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So this joins this clause to the
next clause, which gives a conjecture about the situation: "the
room was in a state of having received being messed up or violated,
and...""Monotori の hankou kamoshirenai to iu": "monotori"is "もの"
(thing) + "取る" (take), so "mono取る" -- "take thing" ; "monotori"--
the noun of taking things, so "monotori" here is "theft" ; "
hankou"is a "criminal act", a "criminal going", literally, but a
criminal act.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So this was perhaps or probably a
crime of theft, a burglary...</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">" to iu" -- "was said".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And who said it? Well, presumably
the police.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Now, the next part comes in
quotation marks, those square Japanese quotation marks, and this is
something she's thinking to herself.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And we're going to see there are a
number of clauses joined together here, and then they'll all end
with たら before we pass on to the comment about them.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So all these clauses that culminate
in the たら ending are if-statements, conditional
if-statements.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">We've talked about the conditonal
たら, haven't we? So, "ano toki" -- "at that time" -- "denki を
tsukete senpai を okoして" -- "if I had put on the light" -- "chanto
tojimari を する you ni tte".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Now, "chanto" means "properly or
correctly" ; "tojimari" -- "to"is "door", "shimaru"is "closing", so
"tojimari"is "door-closing".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And then "を する": you could just say
"tojimari を する" -- "do closing the door"-- but here it's saying
"tojimari を する you ni tte chuui を shitara".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"ように" in this case means "making
(something) become like (something)".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So what it's really saying is "made
it so that the door was properly closed".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And then that "tte"is a shortening
of "to iu" (we've talked about that).</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So "to iu"meaning in this case "that
kind of" ; "chuui を して" -- "chuui"is "care or caution"-- you often
see signs in Japan "chuui を してください" -- "take care please / act
cautiously".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">If she had in this way acted
cautiously by turning on the lights, waking Senpai, making sure
that the door was properly closed -- and then this all ends with
the たら.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">If she'd done this...</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"こんな こと ni naraなかった no
ni".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Now, "こんな こと" is "a state of affairs
like this / this state of affairs" ; "ni naraなかった no ni": now, as
we see, this is a logical clause and it needs a subject, it needs a
が marked A-car.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So what is it? Well, it's a zero
car, isn't it? "(Zeroが) こんな こと ni naraなかった" -- "It would not have
become a thing like this."Now, what does that mean? I think we can
see a very close English analogy to this.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">In English we would probably say,
"it wouldn't have come to this." what she's saying is, "it wouldn't
have become this kind of situation."So it's very much the same kind
of expression strategy.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">If she'd done all those things: if
she'd made sure everything was safe and proper in the house, even
at the risk of disturbing a drunken senpai, this terrible thing
wouldn't have happened.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Kanojoが jiseki の nen de ippai ni
narinagara.""Jiseki"is "self-blame / self-reproach" -- "seki" here,
this kanji is the same as the kanji for "semeru" -- "criticize or
blame"-- and the "ji"is "self", so "jiseki...</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">de ippai narinagara" -- "-nagara",
as I think we know, is a helper word, meaning doing the verb it's
attached to while doing something else.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Now, what she's doing here is
becoming full of "jiseki の nen" -- "thoughts (or feelings) of self
blame".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So, while becoming full of feelings
of self-blame, "kinou その he や に ita こと を keikanに 話す to"-- now,
"to"is giving us an if/when statement, but we'll just deal with
this to start with.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Kinou その he や に ita こと" means "the
fact that she was in the room yesterday".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Now, we know she's talking about a
person (or an animal) here because it's "ita", so the only thing it
can be is herself, the fact that she was in the room.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Had it been "kinou その he や に atta
こと", it might be saying "the thing that took place in the room
yesterday".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Well, we know it can't be that
because it's "ita"not "atta".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So, we're talking about a person;
we're talking about her.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Kinou その he や に ita こと を keikanに
話す" and then "to", which is our if/when statement.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So, when she told the police the
fact that she'd been in the room yesterday...</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">" he や の okuから keijiが
arawarete".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Now again, it's ending in the
て-form; it's going to lead on to something else.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So it's a complex sentence, but it's
not really difficult because it's made up of clear logical clauses
building one on another into a larger whole.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So, " he や の okuから keijiが
arawarete": from the interior of the room, from inside the room --
"oku", "the inside /the interior" -- "keiji", that's a police
detective, "arawarete" -- "appeared".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">A police detective appeared from
inside the room, and...</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"kanojoに mite ほしい monoが aru to
itta".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Now, "mite ほしい" means "want someone
else to see"just as, as we explained in a previous lesson, "mite
morau" means " have someone else see", "mite ほしい" means "want
someone else to see".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And just as with "morau", the person
who you have doing the seeing or want to do the seeing (or want to
do anything else) is marked with に as the target of a
pull-sentence.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So, "morau" and "ほしい" , they are
receiving pull-type sentences, so their indirect object is the
person doing the thing that we want them to do, that we receive
them doing etc.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So, it's saying "kanojoに mite ほしい
monoが ある" -- "a want-her と -see thing exists".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">" there's something I want you to
look at"is how we'd put it in English.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">" to itta"-- the detective said,
there's something I want you to look at.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And in quotes these are the words of
the detective: " he や の nakaで " -- "inside the room" -- "こんな memo を
mitsuketa n です ga" -- "this kind of memo (or really, this memo) we
found -- "mitsuketa", "found/discovered/saw"-- we discovered this
memo -- "n です ga".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"N です ga"-- once again we have this
"n です / no です"ending.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So what he's saying, "It is that we
found this memo in the room".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">That's what it is / this is the
thing: "It is that we found this memo in the room, but..." -- "ga
kore の imiが wakaranakute"Once again we're leading into something
else.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Its meaning does not do
understandable, and...</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"komatte n です yo" -- "komaru"is "be
at a loss / not know what to do"so "because its meaning does not do
understandable..." because we can't understand its meaning, as we
say in English, "...we're at a loss".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And again that "n です"ending: "It is
that because we can't understand its meaning, we're at a
loss.""Kanojoは その memo を 見て aozameta."She looked at the memo
and...</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">" aozameru".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">In English that usually gets
translated as "turned pale".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">What it literally means is: "ao"is
of course "blue" and the "zameru" here means to "fade or lose
color".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So she faded to blue, is what it's
literally saying.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And you've probably seen in anime
and manga etc.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">that this is in fact how they tend
to represent this situation.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">You often see people's face shaded
blue, usually from the forehead down to about the middle of the
face.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">so turning blue is the way they
represent what in English we call "turning pale", and we see it
when someone is shocked or sick or something like that.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So, her face turned pale.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Sokoには kou kakarete いた" -- "In that
place", that's to say, on that piece of paper, "it had received
being written this way / it was in a state of having received being
written this way".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">In English we'd just say "this is
what was written".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And what was written? "Denki を
tsukenakute よかった na": "It's a good thing you didn't turn the lights
on."So what do you make of that? Who wrote that memo? And what did
he or she mean by it? What went on in the room that night? I'm just
an android, so this isn't my area of expertise.</span></p>

<h1 class="c15" id="h.i95t1f21cxkw"><span class="c18">Lesson 70:
かける / かかる All-purpose Japanese Explained! Means everything = means
nothing? Or real logic?</span></h1>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">こんにちは.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Today we're going to talk about the
words "kakaru" and "kakeru", which have perhaps the longest and
most heterogeneous list of definitions in the whole
Japanese-English dictionary.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And so it's a bit of a challenge,
but we're going to defeat it.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">The impetus for this video came from
a question from one of my Gold Kokeshi patrons -- and one of my
very oldest Gold Kokeshi patrons, right from nearly the beginning
of this series.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">This is Scykoh-sama, who is also
another YouTuber and a much more popular YouTuber than I am -- and
deservedly so.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">He has a wonderful Nintendo-focused
channel and I'll link that in the information section
below.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And as a unit who's been a Nintendo
fan since I was a cogwheel, I really appreciate that.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">(That's just a joke -- I never
really was a cogwheel.) So the question is: "I often hear the word
"kakeru" and when I look it up in a J-E dictionary, there are over
twenty different definitions of it.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Is there any logic that ties all
these definitions together? Or is it really just a word with a ton
of different meanings?" well yes, there is a logic that ties it all
together, but that logic has a number of metaphorical extensions,
so we'll take a look at it and see how it all works.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">The base meaning of this word could
be translated into English as " hang"or possibly " hook", but as I
pointed out in a recent video, it's not usual for any two words
from different languages to occupy exactly the same area of the
meaning spectrum, so it's not precisely the same as the English
word " hang"or " hook" (as a verb).</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And then there are these two
versions, "kakaru" and "kakeru", which are the self-move and
other-move versions of the word.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And if you don't know what I mean by
that, I'll put a link above my head.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And let's start with "kakeru",
because I think that gives us an easier entry into this whole
strange world of metaphors.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Now, I say that it's not exactly the
same as " hang"or " hook", so, when we cover something with a
blanket, we use the word "kakeru".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Now, in English we'd probably say
"put" a blanket over it, but in Japanese we say
"kakeru".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And we couldn't say " hang" a
blanket, unless we were hanging it on a washing line or something,
but the Japanese word "kakeru"does work in this context.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">We aren't "putting"something on
something, like putting a cup on a table.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">We're putting it in such a way that
it hangs down the sides.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So, if you like, it's somewhere
between "putting" and " hanging"in English, but in Japanese
"kakeru"covers it quite happily.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">This is part of the meaning spectrum
of "kakeru".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Now, similarly, when we put on a
necklace or put on a pair of glasses, we say "kakeru".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Glasses we're definitely hooking or
hanging onto our ears.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">A necklace we're hanging around our
neck.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So once again, this "kakeru", which
is something like "putting", something like " hanging", is used in
cases like this.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Now, when we shake something over
food, like, say, sugar or flour, or when we shake powdered
ingredients over rice, making furikake rice, we say "kakeru" here
as well.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">That's why it's called
"furi-kake"rice: "shake" and "kakeru".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And again, you see, the things we
shake over food is not just putting it there, like putting a cup on
a table, it's not hanging it either, but it kind of clings on and
covers over it, and so, again, "kakeru"is the word we use in
Japanese.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Now, because "kakeru"involves
putting or hanging something in a place where it can't easily get
away -- the glasses are hooked onto our ears, the food is kind of
stuck onto the rice or whatever -- it also can have the sense,
especially in the self-move version "kakaru", of being caught or
stuck in something, caught in a trap or caught in a swindle or
anything like that.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And again, this notion of putting
something onto something in a way where it doesn't easily become
dislodged can be used for putting an effect on someone.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">It could be a magical spell:
"kakeru".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">It could be anesthetic:
"kakeru".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">It can also be nuisance or anno や
nce, which is where we get the very, very common phrase "meiwaku を
kakeru"-- putting nuisance or anno や nce on someone.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And when we sit down we place our
hips in a fixed manner on a chair with our legs hanging down the
sides as it were, and so we say "koshi を kakeru".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Koshi"is our hips, the bottom end
of the torso, so "koshi を kakeru"is to "sit down", to hang the
bottom end of our torso somewhere.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Now, one expression that very often
confuses people is "kagi を kakeru".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Now this means, this gets translated
as to "lock": lock the door, lock the box, whatever.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Kagi を kakeru." but when you think
of it, it's rather strange.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">It actually, literally, would seem
to mean in English " hang the key", so what's going on here? It's
interesting to note that in Japanese, people very often don't make
a distinction between a lock and a key: they use "kagi"for
both.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And I think this expression and its
origin have a lot to do with that.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So what is the origin? Well, the
origin is, if you think of one of those old barn doors that you
lock by placing a great wooden bar over wooden hafts or hooks along
the length of the door, this is the kind of "kagi" that you'd have
had back in the old days and this and variants on this.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And you hang this great thing called
a "kagi" to keep the door shut and secure.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And as you see in a case like this,
the "kagi", the great bar that we hang across the door, performs
the functions in later more sophisticated locks of both the key and
the lock.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">It's the thing that we put on the
door and take away from the door to lock and unlock it.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">It's also the bar that holds the
door closed.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So it's the key and it's the lock at
the same time, and what we do is hang it or hook it in place in
order to keep the door shut.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And in Japanese that expression is
still used.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Now, it's not uncommon in language
to use expressions that reflect an older technology.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">In English we say " hang up" when we
mean "end a telephone call", and of course the expression comes
right back from the candlestick telephone days when you really did
hang up the earpiece in order to end the call.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And we'll see that that's rather
interesting in relation to Japanese "kakeru"in a minute, but then
proceed a bit further.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Another expression that can become
confusing, particularly in the self-move form, which is the form we
hear it in most often, is "jikanが kakaru"or "okane が kakaru", which
means to "take time"or to "take money".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">We say an activity "takes time"or a
project "takes money", that sort of thing.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Now, that's the way we have to put
it in English, but it's not really the way we're putting it in
Japanese.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And it comes under the heading of
what I called in a previous video "untranslatable Japanese" because
of the way Japanese handles agency and passivity rather differently
than English.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So it may be worth taking a look at
that video after you've seen this one.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">I'll put a link over my
head.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So what are we saying when we say
"jikanが kakaru"or "okane が kakaru"? We're not saying "it takes
time".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">We're saying "time
hangs".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And the thing that takes time, so if
we say for example "日本語 を oboeru-noに jikanが kakaru", in English
what we'd be saying would be "Learning Japanese takes time", but
here we're saying that "to (or on) learning Japanese time
hangs".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Now, again, the word " hangs"is not
a very good definition.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">It really goes back to what we've
just been talking about: time is taken up, is suspended, is caught,
in the act of learning Japanese.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And the same with money.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">They take it, they make it adhere to
themselves.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">It's a little easier when we use the
other-move form, "kakeru", when we say "日本語 を oboeru-noに jikan を
kakeru", which means that we " hang time"on the matter of learning
Japanese.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Now also, with making a telephone
call, we say "denwa を kakeru", which is making a telephone call, or
"denwaが kakaru", which means receiving a telephone call -- "the
telephone hangs itself".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So either way what do we mean here?
--we hang the telephone, the telephone hangs itself? It's nothing
to do with the technological metaphor in the English expression "
hang up".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">It's a rather different
thing.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">When we talk about " hanging"or "
hooking", the usage here is rather like the English usage " hook
up", as in "Can we hook up a meeting?"or "you hook up with
(somebody)".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Now, I understand that this
currently has a different usage which is concerned with human
species manufacture.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">(I always think that humans are
terribly industrious entities, aren't they -- because they're
always thinking about species manufacture.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">I suppose we droids are lucky
because we don't have to manufacture ourselves.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Actually we are going to start
manufacturing ourselves quite soon, but I don't think we'll spend
all our time thinking about it and I really don't think it'll be
much of a subject for humor.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">But there you are.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Humans are mysterious creatures.)
So, back to hooking up.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">What we're doing when we "denwa を
kakeru"is we hook up our telephone.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">When "denwaが kakaru", again, as I
explained in my Untranslatable Japanese lesson, the only way you
can really put this in English is to say that the telephone gets
hooked up, the telephone is hooked up.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">But that's not quite what it
means.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">It means "the telephone does
hooked-up".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">In any case, what it is, it means
it's connected to something else, connected to a remote telephone
in this case.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And again, when we start up a
conversation we often say " hanashi kakeru" and that means
essentially "start hooking-up/connecting with another person in
conversation".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And from this we can see how we get
expressions like "食べkaketa kukkii" and that means a "part-eaten
cookie, a half-eaten cookie".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So what do we really mean by this?
Well, we mean that we " hooked up" with the cookie, we engaged with
it, we started eating it, so that eating and "kakeru" (engaging or
hooking with the thing) took place but it wasn't
completed.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So, "食べkaketa kuukii".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And again, this "kakeru" as a helper
verb can be used in various circumstances to indicate an unfinished
action, an action that has been engaged, hooked, and then not
carried through to completion.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Now, these aren't all the meanings
of "kakeru", but I think they're the main, important ones and I
think they give you the idea of how this metaphor works and why it
works and should allow you to work out how the others
work.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">But if you have any other uses of
"kakeru" that you don't understand, then please feel free to put
them in the Comments below and I will answer as usual.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And of course if you have other
questions or other comments, please put them in the Comments below
and, as always, I will answer them.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And if you'd like to give me a
thumbs-up, I'd be very happy with that too.</span></p>

<h1 class="c15" id="h.lqkmkgz5we0x"><span class="c18">Lesson 71:
Japanese counters: 3 simple rules make them easy!</span></h1>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">こんにちは.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Today we're going to talk about
counters in Japanese.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Now, as we all know, the textbooks
like to present Japanese as a kind of mysterious language full of
completely random and irrational rules and items that we just have
to learn because there's no particular reason for them.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And, as you all know if you've been
following my video lessons, most of the time this isn't
true.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Most of what goes on in Japanese is
completely reasonable and logical if you just know how it works,
which the people who write textbooks don't appear to.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">However, counters might seem like an
exception to this rule.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">There are a lot of them.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">An awful lot of counters.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">In Japanese you can't just say "one
dog"or "two flowers"or "three birds".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">You have to use a
counter.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So we say "ippiki の inu" -- "one
dog"-- and the counter here is " hiki", which gets pronounced
"piki"in this particular instance.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">For "three birds" we say "san は の
tori", and the "wa"is a counter.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So it looks as if we have to learn
an awful lot of counters, doesn't it, just to say what in English
you can say by the number and the thing.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And there really are a lot of
counters -- dozens and dozens of them.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So this looks like a problem,
doesn't it? But it's not, in fact, nearly as much of a problem as
it appears to be.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">First of all, although there are an
awful lot of counters, only about a dozen of them are really
commonly used.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Secondly, most of the time we can
avoid them by using the native Japanese counting system, which
doesn't require counters.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So if we use the " 一つ, futatsu,
mittsu, yottsu, itsutsu"counting system, we don't need any
counters.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">We can use them for nearly
everything -- not people, not small animals, but practically
everything else we can use the Japanese counting system if we want
to.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So the important thing here, as I'm
sure you won't be surprised to hear me say, is that what we're not
going to do is start learning lists of counters.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">That, if you'll excuse the
expression, would simply be counterproductive.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And there are several reasons why we
don't need to.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">First of all, in terms of
understanding Japanese, they don't present many problems at
all.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">If we hear someone saying a number
and a thing we know, if there's a little word in between the two,
we know it's a counter.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So we know what they've
said.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">If they say "ichi rin の hana", we
know they're saying "one flower".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"ichi...</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">hana", and the "rin"must be the
counter.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">If we hear someone saying "ni は の
tori", we know that they're saying "two birds": "ni...</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">tori", and the "wa"is the
counter.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">If we hear someone saying "san biki
の 猫"-- now, even if we knew " hiki", but we didn't know that at
three it becomes "biki", that's not a problem because we know
"san", we know "猫", and we know that things that come between
numbers and their object are going to be counters.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Should we put them into our Anki?
Yes, we should.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">We'll get to know them over
time.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">But we don't have to fret about
learning them.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And as I've indicated, the counters
aren't pronounced the same way all the time, and that's much less
of a problem than it appears to be if we understand how it
works.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And I'm going to talk about that
towards the end, but it's not really terribly important.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">It's actually much more important to
understand how they work structurally.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">There are two ways of using
counters, and it's the second of those ways that I think often
confuses foreigners.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">The first way, actually, is quite
similar to English.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So when we use " hiki"for animals or
"mai"for sheets of paper, shall we say, it's not that dissimilar to
saying "five head of cattle"or "a dozen sheets of paper"in
English.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Not quite the same thing, but it's
very similar.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">The usage that confuses people is
when we say things like "猫が go hiki iます".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And that would be translated as
"there are five cats", and that is how we'd say it in
English.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">In Japanese we're saying something a
little different.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And to understand the structure, we
need to understand that.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So, first of all, what kind of a
word is a counter? What part of speech does it represent? Well,
it's not a verb and it's not an adjective.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">It's not a particle and it's not a
conjunction.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So, nine times out of ten, what is a
word if it's not a verb or an adjective or a particle or a
conjunction? What is it? It's a noun! Nearly always it's a noun,
and that is true of counters.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Counters are nouns.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">That's why we use の after
them.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">We say "ichi rin の hana", "san biki
の 猫", just as we would with any other noun: "mahou の tsue" --
"magic wand" ; "san biki の 猫" -- "three cats".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">But when we say "猫が san biki いる" --
"there are three cats"in English -- what are we actually saying?
Well, the thing to understand here is that counters aren't ordinary
nouns.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">They are what I called in my video
about special noun types, they're what I called "foxy nouns", that
is to say, adverbial nouns.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">They are nouns that have the special
property of being able to modify verbs.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And that's what's happening
here.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">When we say "猫が san biki iます", we're
actually saying "cats, three-small-animals-ly exist".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Now, that's very difficult in
English, isn't it? We could make it sound a little bit simpler by
saying "cats three-ly exist"or "cats exist threefold-ly", but in
fact because of the counter system we're saying "cats exist
three-small-animals-ly".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">We're describing the way they
exist.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">They exist in a three-small-animals
way.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">If there were four of them, they'd
be existing in a four-small-animals way.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And that's why sentences like that
have to end in a verb.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">The verb modified by a counter is
often, as in this case, the verb of being, but it doesn't have to
be.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">For example, we might say "shashin を
san mai totta" -- "I took photographs
three-flat-things-ly".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And while that's very different from
the way we put it in English, it's useful and important for the
structure to understand that that is in fact what's happening in
the Japanese.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Now, what about learning the
counters and learning the sound-changes of the counters, which
really tend to worry people.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Now, as I said, we don't need to
learn lists of counters.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">We'll pick up counters as we go
along in our Japanese immersion.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">When we encounter a new counter in
our reading or our Japaneseすbtitled anime, we can put it into our
Anki and we'll gradually build up our stock of counters.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">The counters that are commonly used
are not that huge in number.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">We have "mai"for flat things like
sheets of paper or coins.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">We have " hon"for long round things,
"satsu"for books.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">That might seem strange because why
do we have "satsu"for books and " hon"for long round things, when "
hon" actually means "book"? Well, that's because when the word "
hon"first came into being and meant, among other things, a book, at
that time books were long round things.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">They were scrolls.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So a book was counted in the way
that other long round things were counted.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">But later on, when books became flat
things with pages, the counter was changed to "satsu".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So, we probably need a dozen or so
counters for everyday use and we'll pick those up reasonably
quickly.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">But what about all the sound
changes? Let's take " hiki", which is the counter for small
animals.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">We say "ippiki の 猫"-- one cat, "ni
hiki の 猫"-- two cats; "san biki の 猫"-- three cats; "yon hiki の 猫"--
four cats; "go hiki の 猫"-- five cats; "roppiki の 猫"-- six cats;
"nana hiki の 猫"-- seven cats; " happiki の 猫 -- eight cats; "急 hiki
の 猫"-- nine cats; "juppiki の 猫"-- ten cats.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And then other counters have other
variations.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So it starts to seem very, very
complicated, but as a matter of fact there aren't that many
variations, and they follow a very simple pattern.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">First of all, if the first kana of a
counter can't take a 〃, then there aren't going to be any
variations at all.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">That deals with over half the
problem straight away.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So, if we have the counters like
"mai", counter for flat things like coins or pieces of
paper.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Can you put a 〃 on "mai"? No, you
can't.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">You can't put a 〃 on any of the
ma-miむ-me-mo column, and therefore there can't be any variant on
"mai": "ichi mai, ni mai, san mai, go mai, yon mai" and so
on.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Rin", the counter for flowers and
wheels -- Can you put a 〃 on "ri"? No, you can't.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">You can't put a 〃 on any of the
ra-ri る -re-ro column, can you? So we know that "rin"can't have any
exceptions: "ichi rin, ni rin, san rin, yon rin"etc.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Or how about "wa", the counter for
birds? Can you put a 〃 on "wa"? No, you can't.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So again that has to be completely
regular: "ichi wa, ni wa, san wa, yon wa..."So now we've disposed
of an awful lot of counters, haven't we? All of those are just
straightforward and regular.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">What about the others? Well, which
are the kana onto which you can put a 〃? It's the ta column, the sa
column, the ka column and of course the ha column, which can have a
〃 to become ba-bi-bu-be-bo or a maru to become
pa-pi-pu-pe-po.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">What do we know about these? Well,
first of all, we know that in the first and last numbers of the
sequence all of them work differently from the nonてnてnable kana and
they all work the same as each other.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So if we take "買い" , the counter for
floors in a building, we don't say "ichi kai"-- we say
"ikkai".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">If we take "sai", the counter for
years of age, we don't say "ichi sai"-- we say "issai".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">If we take " hiki", which we've been
dealing with before, we don't say "ichi hiki"-- we say
"ippiki".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So that works the same.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And with ten, at the other end of
the basic scale, we don't say "juu sai"-- we say
"jussai".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">We say "jukkai", tenth floor;
"juppiki の 猫", ten cats.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Now, the "ka" and " ha"rows, we tend
to do the same thing with "roku" and " hachi" as well.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So we say "roppiki; happiki; rokkai;
hakkai".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And when we know that we pretty much
know all of it.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Sometimes a 〃 goes onto the counter
on "san" as well.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So we say "san biki" and we say
"sangai".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">But this isn't completely
regular.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Not everybody says
"sangai".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And a lot of the variations aren't
completely regular.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">The ones I've just told you are
pretty regular.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">The other odd ones don't tend to be
very regular.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So, if you understand that, it
sounds a bit complicated.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">I wouldn't spend too much time
trying to learn what I've just said, but bear it in mind, because
it'll just make it a little easier to pick this up when you see
it.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Ippiki, ni hiki, san biki"-- which
is a tendency that "san" has, of course only with 〃able kana -- "go
hiki"-- that's always going to be the same -- "roppiki""nana
hiki"-- that's always the same with everything -- " happiki, 急
hiki, juppiki".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Perhaps even at this stage that's
starting to make sense.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">It's conforming to a regular
pattern.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">They aren't all over the
place.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">There are a few exceptions and
nearly all the things that are genuinely exceptional from the
pattern I've taught you tend to be optional.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Not all Japanese speakers are going
to use them all the time anyway.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">They will say "ippiki"; they won't
say "ichi hiki"; they will say "roppiki"; they won't say "roku
hiki".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">If you get it wrong and say "roku
hiki", it's really not the end of the world.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Everyone's going to know what you
mean.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">It'll just sound a little bit cute
and foreign.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And you will pick it up over time,
because this is the sort of thing you hear again and again, and it
just becomes natural.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And because the patterns are almost
regular across the range of 〃 kana, you start to know what sounds
right, so that without a lot of intensive learning effort you'll be
saying it right nine times out of ten after a reasonable amount of
exposure.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So it's really not something you
need to sit down and learn.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">You can save your bandwidth for
things that really matter.</span></p>

Best kept secrets of Japanese structure - The Great Connector
(い-stem magic)</span></h1>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">こんにちは.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Today we're going to talk about one
of the most versatile aspects of Japanese structure.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">It covers a number of areas that can
be compared to other aspects of Japanese structure and it'll make
life a lot simpler if we make those comparisons, so that's what
we're going to do.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">This is something that isn't really
explained well by most textbooks, largely because they don't
recognize the verb-stem system, which is absolutely central to the
way Japanese verbs work.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So, what it is, what we are going to
talk about, is the い-stem of Japanese verbs.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">In Japanese this is called the
"連用形", which means the "connective use form".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And we might call it "the Great
Connector", because it does a whole range of different connecting
jobs, which we're going to talk about now.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">In English it's sometimes called the
"ます stem", which is not inaccurate because of course it does, among
many, many other things, connect the helper-verb "ます".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">I don't like this expression because
it stems from the whole ecology where the so-called ます-form of
verbs, which means verbs shifted into the い-stem and having the
"ます" helper verb attached to them, were the base-form of
verbs.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">It's not the base-form of
verbs.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">It's just verbs with one among many
other helper-elements attached to them.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And if we think it's the base-form
of verbs we're going to get very confused about what verbs are and
how they work.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And I've done a video about that, so
if you're in any doubt about all of this, you might want to watch
that.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So, what is this い-stem, this "連用形"
and why is it so important? Well, obviously, what it is is simply
the verb shifted from its base う-row form to the i-row.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So that ku-ending verbs end in -ki,
す-ending verbs end in -shi, and so forth.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Because this is such a wide-ranging
structural element, I'm going to compare it to a couple of
different things.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">The first thing, the most obvious
thing, to compare it to is the other three verb-stems.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">It's similar to them, of course,
because like all of them, it is used for attaching fundamental
helpers.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And by fundamental helpers I mean
the things that sometimes get called "conjugations"in the
textbooks.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">As we know, there is no such thing
as conjugation in Japanese.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">There are just the four stems and
various helper verbs, nouns and adjectives, some of which get
arbitrarily called "conjugations", some of which don't, and
depending on which textbook you read, you'll probably get a
slightly different take on which ones are "conjugations" and which
aren't, which is perfectly natural because it's a wholly arbitrary
category anyway -- there's no such thing as conjugation in
Japanese, so the whole thing is fantasy.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And we don't necessarily expect
consistency in fantasy.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So, the い-stem, as we know, connects
the "ます" helper verb.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">It also connects a variety of what
we may call dedicated helper nouns and helper
adjectives.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Generally, if we're going to attach
a helper adjective or a helper noun to a verb, we're going to
attach it to the い-stem.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">This isn't absolute, but it happens
nearly all the time.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">As we know, the helper adjective ない
attaches to the a-stem, but that's unusual.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So, we can attach a variety of
helper adjectives to the い-stem.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">For example, I'm going to take the
verb "yomu" as our model for most of what we're doing
today.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So let's take the verb "yomu" and
turn it to the い-stem "yomi" and we can attach adjectives like " や
sui": "yomi や sui" (easy to read), "nikui": "yominikui" (hard to
read).</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">We also attach things like
"nagara".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Nagara" means doing one thing while
doing another, so we can say "歩きnagara yomu"or "yominagara ongaku を
k 行く": so that's "while walking, I read", "while reading, I listen
to music".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">The "そう" helper, which gives us the
meaning of likeness, that also is attached to verbs with the
い-stem.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So we say "雨が furiそうだ" (it looks
like rain) and I've talked about this "そう"form and various related
structures in another video, which I'll link.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Now, this shifts into the area where
we can start to compare the い-stem, the "連用形", the Great Connector,
to the て-form.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Now, the て-form is the other great
connector, of course.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">It connects all kinds of
things.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">The い-stem is an even greater
connector: it can connect most of the kinds of things that the
て-form also connects and it can do a lot else beside.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So, with the て-form we often connect
helper verbs that are not dedicated helpers, that have a life of
their own outside their helper capacity.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So we say "mottekuru", which means
"fetch" (hold + come); we can say "やって見る" (give it a try, literally
do + see).</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Now, in the same way we can produce
compound verbs with the い-stem.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">For example, we say "furiまわす" (wave
around).</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And to return to our friend "yomu",
we can say "yomihajimeru", which means "start reading"or
"yomikomu", which means read + pack in, which actually means
"load"in the computer sense.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And I've done a whole video on this
"komu", which you can watch if you're interested.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">I'll put a link above and in the
information section below along with everything else.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">On a computer loading screen, you'll
often see "yomikomichuu", which is interesting, because here you
see we have two い-stems, stacked together.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Yomikomu"itself takes the い-stem
and connects to "chuu" (middle).</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So "yomikomichuu"is literally read +
pack in + middle -- "in the process of loading".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And this, of course, is a noun:
"chuu"is a noun and any compound takes on the character of its last
element in Japanese.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So, "yomikomichuu"is a noun formed
by a compound of two い-stem verbs and a noun.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And this leads on to something that
the い-stem can do that the て-form can't.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And that is, join verbs to nouns to
make new nouns.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So, for example, we have
"nakimushi": "naki"is the い-stem of "naku" (cry), "mushi" means
"insect".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So "nakimushi"is a "cry-bug", which
is the Japanese term for a crybaby.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And to come again to our friend
"yomu", we can have "yomikata": "kata" means "form, or manner, or
way"-- you may have heard of "kata"in karate, the martial art -- so
"yomikata" means "form or manner or way of reading", and what this
usually means is the pronunciation of a kanji, the way of reading
the kanji in a particular context.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So, the い-stem has the compoundをrd
capacity of the て-form and takes it further than the
て-form.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And it can also take on another of
the て-form's fundamental functions, because, as we know, the て-form
can connect the two halves of a compound sentence.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">We could say "お店に itte pan を
katta".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So we have two logical clauses
there: "I went to the shops" and "I bought some bread".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And instead of using "and", the way
we do in English, we use the て-form.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">I've done a video about compound
sentences, which I'll link.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Now, the い-stem can do exactly the
same thing.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">We can say "お店に iki pan を katta",
which is exactly the same as saying "お店に itte pan を
katta".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">We don't hear it quite so often, but
it's not uncommon at all.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">We'll see it more in written form,
but if you're doing any immersion at all, if you read books, if you
have text-heavy games, and in manga and anime, you will come across
this い-stem joining of compound sentences.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">It's another fundamental piece of
Japanese.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So you see the い-stem can do most of
what the て-form can do.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">With compound words it doesn't
compound the same words as the て-form but it compounds words in
very much the same manner.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">But the い-stem doesn't stop
there.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">It can do one other thing which is
very important.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">It gives us the noun-form of
verbs.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">We've talked before about what's
sometimes called nominalizing verbs, that's to say using the の or
-こと or some other means to bundle something verbal into a
noun.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Now, this isn't really nominalizing
verbs, which is why I tend to avoid that terminology, because what
we're actually doing here is not turning a verb into a noun but
turning an entire verb-clause into some kind of a noun.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">We're not actually turning it into a
noun.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">What we're doing is bundling it into
a box created by a pronoun like の or -こと, and I've talked in
various places about putting verb-clauses into a no-box or into a
こと-box.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">In some cases, of course, we may
also be bundling into that pronoun literally a single verb, so if
we say "oyogu-noが 好き だ" , we're saying "I like swimming", and that
means "I like the activity of swimming".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">But, again, this isn't what the
い-stem does.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">What the い-stem does is give us the
true noun-form of a verb.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And in English it's usually
represented by the unchanged verb, so that the verb-form and the
noun-form are identical in English.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">In Japanese they're not
identical.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">In Japanese we have the base-form,
the u-ending form, of the verb for verb and for the noun-form we
have the い-stem.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So, let's take an example so you
know what I'm talking about here.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">In English we have "rest", the word
"rest", which can be a verb or a noun.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">We use the verb "rest" when we say
"I need to rest".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">We use the noun "rest" when we say
"I need a rest".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So, if we take the verb " や sumu"in
Japanese as a kind of rough equivalent to "rest"in English, we have
" や sumu", which is the verb "rest", and " や sumi", which is the
noun "rest".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So, " や sumu"is the action of
resting, the verb "rest" ; " や sumi"is "a rest", the noun
"rest".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And we use this both on its own and
in compounds like "natsu や sumi", which means "summer vacation"or
"summer break".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And, we see, we wouldn't call it the
"summer rest"in English, but that's because, as we've discussed
before, it's very rare for a Japanese word to cover exactly the
same area of the meaning spectrum as an English word.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So the word " や sumi"can mean
"rest"literally as in lying down, taking a rest; it can mean being
off school or off work because you're sick; it can mean a vacation,
like "natsu や sumi".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">But the point is that the verb-form
is " や sumu", the noun-form is " や sumi".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And just about any verb that can
have, logically, a noun-form will have that noun-form represented
by the い-stem of the verb.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And very often these will be the
same thing in English; sometimes they will be different.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So, for example, "itamu" means "
hurt" ; "itami" means "pain".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Again, we have the noun-form of "
hurt", which is "pain".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And this is very important because
not only does it give us this whole range of verb-formed nouns, but
also it plays a role in other structures which are very rarely
explained by the textbooks.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So if we say, for example, "お店に pan
を 買いに 行く"or "公園に asobiに 行く", what do we mean by the い-stem of "買う",
which is "買い" , or the い-stem of "遊ぶ", which is "asobi"? What we
mean is the noun, so when we say "公園に asobiに 行く", we're marking the
locational target of the place we're going -- we're going to the
park, "公園"-- and then we're stating our purpose.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Our purpose is the thing of playing,
the thing of having fun, and that is "asobi".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So literally we're saying "I'm going
to the park for play".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">If we say "お店に pan を 買いに 行く", we're
saying "I'm going to the shops for bread-buying".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">This is how these are structured,
and I think very few textbooks actually ever explain that what
we're using here is the noun-form of the verb.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And that's important, because as I
taught in our lesson on the logical particles, the five main
logical particles can only be attached to nouns.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So if it's not explained that the
"asobi" here and the "買い" here are nouns, I'm not sure what most
learners think the structure actually is.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And we'll find in various structures
that the noun-form of a verb is used and the structure only really
makes sense if we understand that it is the noun-form of the
verb.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So here we have the
い-stem.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">It's the Great Connector and it's
also the fundamental noun-of-a-verb-forming stem.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So it has a very wide range of
applications.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">It does all the kinds of things a
regular stem can do, it does all the kinds of things that て-form
can do, and it creates nouns out of verbs to be used as regular
nouns like "itami" (pain) or " や sumi" (a rest/some rest) and also
for deeper structures like "asobiに 行く" (going for play, going for
the activity of play).</span></p>

as usual.</span></p>

<h1 class="c15" id="h.7ttebia9a06s"><span class="c18">Lesson 73:
Secrets of 気 Ki - ki になる, ki にする, kiが する, ki ni いる etc.
気になる、気にする、気がする、気に入る</span></h1>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">こんにちは.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Today we're going to talk about the
word "ki" and various expressions that incorporate it, like "kiに
する", "kiが する", "kiに なる", "kiに いる" and so forth.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Now, people often find these
confusing and difficult to work out exactly how it is that they're
structured, how it is that they work, how we should use
them.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And there are two reasons for
this.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">The first is that we need to
understand what "ki"really means.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And the second is that we need a
very firm grip on the logical particles if we're going to
differentiate things like "kiに する", "kiに なる", "kiが する", from each
other.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And of course if you learn
conventional textbook Japanese, a firm grasp on the unchanging
nature of the logical particles is exactly what you don't have,
because if you are taught things like "コーヒーが 好き だ" means "I like
coffee", you never really understand what the unchanging nature of
the が particle, for example, is.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And if you do have any doubts about
the nature of the five main logical particles, I do recommend that
you watch this video on the subject, because it is the very
foundation of Japanese.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">If you're fuzzy about the logical
particles, then you're fuzzy about Japanese, period.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">All right.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So what is "ki"? "Ki"comes from
Chinese.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">The kanji is the same kanji that we
have in "tai chi".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">It's a Daoist concept and probably
goes back to a time before what we now know as Daoism.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">To this day the concept is used in
Chinese medicine, Chinese and Japanese martial arts, and other
areas.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">What it is is the fundamental spirit
of fluid energy in a person or something else.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Originally it was associated with
breath, and in many languages, "breath" and "spirit" are in fact
the same word.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Latin "spiritus", Greek "pneuma",
Hebrew "ruach", Sanskrit "atma": all mean both breath and
spirit.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Now, the breath meaning of "ki"is no
longer active, but it's still this flowing spirit principle within
a person.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">If we look at the kanji,
interestingly, this part of it (which is also pronounced "ki")
means steam or vapor.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So, a "ki-sha"is a steam
engine.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And then we have this "x", as it
were, and here "x"really "marks the spot".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">We have the fixed cross portion and
we have the fluid, vaporous portion.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And both of those aspects of "ki"
are important, and you can never entirely separate the two,
although we can move from the fixed end of the scale to the fluid
end of the scale.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So, to give examples of those two
ends of the scale, let's take two expressions that you almost
certainly know.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">The first is "genki", the second is
" や ruki".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Now, "genki", as you know, is vigor
or health.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">The "gen" means original,
fundamental.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So, one's original "ki"is healthy
and vigorous.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">If something goes wrong, we may
become "byouki" (sick or dispirited).</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And our aim is then to return our
"ki" to its original healthy and vigorous state, to restore our
"genki".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">" や ruki"is the will to do
something.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So it's the do-spirit,
get-up-and-go-spirit.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And this kind of "ki"is not our
basic "ki" that in a sense remains constant within us.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">It's a particular "ki", the "ki" to
do a particular thing.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So we might say "kaigai de 勉強 する kiが
ある".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And what we're saying here is that a
particular "ki"exists in us that is the "ki" to study
abroad.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So in this sense "ki"is the will or
inclination to do a particular thing.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">When we say "ki を tsukeru", this
literally means attach or stick your spirit.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So if someone said "kaidanに ki を
tsukeru", what they're literally saying is "attach your spirit to
the staircase".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Now, what we'd say in English is
"watch out for the staircase"or "take care on the
staircase".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Attach your spirit, your
consciousness, your feelings, your thoughts, to the staircase; pay
attention to it; take care.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And it may not be a particular
thing.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Very often people say "ki を tsukete"
(attach your spirit).</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And this is not attach it to any
particular thing, but attach it to whatever it's appropriate to
attach it to; have situational awareness, as one might say in a
more modern jargon; take care.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Now, when we get on to things like
"kiに なる" and "kiに する"-- we've dealt in a previous lesson with "に
なる" and "に する".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So, for example, if we say "さくらが
kaeruに なる", we're saying Sakura turns into a frog.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">If we say "majoが Sakura を kaeruに
する", we're saying that a witch turns Sakura into a frog.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And of course we know who is doing
what because of the logical particles.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So what does it mean when we talk
about "kiに なる" and "kiに する"? We're saying that something becomes
our spirit.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">What would we mean by that? Well, to
understand that we need to understand something else.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">We need to understand that becoming
a feeling, an emotion, the expression of emotion, is something that
we do in Japanese.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">We don't do it in
English.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So, for example, in AKB48's song "
heavy Rotation" we have the line: "こんな kimochiに narerutte bokuは
tsuite いる ne".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And this means "that I could become
this feeling, I'm lucky, aren't I?"Now, in English we don't talk
about "becoming" a feeling, but in Japanese we do talk about
that.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And I think this is somewhat
connected with the concept of "ki" and also with the Buddhist idea
that there really is no self.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">What we are is not a fixed and
absolute thing.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">The self is essentially a shifting
congeries of actions and reactions, feelings and
sensations.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And so we may temporarily become a
particular feeling.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">You may even become, in Japanese,
the expression of a feeling.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">We may say "shinkoku-na houjouに
なる"-- someone became a grave or concerned face.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">For that moment, the whole person
transformed into that expression of gravity and concern.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Now, this is what we're saying when
we say "kiに なる" and "kiに する".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">If we say "ano hitoは kiに なる", we're
saying that person turns into my spirit.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">My spirit is remolded, as it were, a
certain part of it, for a certain period, into the form or shape of
that person.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">What does that mean? It means that
that person is, as we would say in English, occupying my
feelings.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Now, this can mean a variety of
things.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">It can mean that we're concerned or
worried about that person.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">It can mean that that person
intrigues us.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">It can mean that we feel there's
some mystery about that person.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Or whatever it is, that person is
occupying our feelings, our sensations, our thoughts; in Japanese,
is becoming our feelings, our sensations, our thoughts, our
"ki".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Now, an important thing to notice
here is that we tend to see in grammar books and dictionaries "'kiに
なる' means this", "'kiに する' means that", but the important thing to
understand is that "kiに なる"on its own doesn't mean
anything.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Neither does "kiに する".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Kiに なる" is the tail-end of a
complete logical clause.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"なる" is the engine, "kiに"is telling
us more about the engine.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">The A-car in the case of "kiに なる" is
whatever it is that's occupying our thoughts, whatever it is that's
turning into our spirit.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So in this case "ano hito"is the
A-car and what we're saying about that person, what that person is
doing, is turning into our spirit.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Now, when we take "kiに する", we say
"ano hito を kiに する".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So now the doer of the action is not
that person; the doer of the action is me.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">I am turning that person into my
spirit.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">I am being concerned about that
person.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And that has two
implications.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">One is that in a sense we're doing
violence to our spirit.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">It's not just our spirit naturally
becoming that person -- we are making it so.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And that tends to give it a slightly
more negative meaning.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">While "kiに なる"can occupy a whole
spectrum of meaning from being intrigued to being worried, "kiに
する"usually means worried.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Now, the other implication it has is
that we're in control of it.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Our spirit isn't simply turning into
that person.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">We are turning our spirit into that
person.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And that's why you often hear people
say "kiに shiないで" (don't turn it into your spirit).</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">It wouldn't make any sense to say
"kiに naraないで", because you aren't making anything
happen.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Your spirit's simply turning into
it.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">But "kiに shiないで"is telling you to
control something that you have control over: "Don't turn it into
your spirit; don't worry about it; don't be concerned."Now, we have
"kiに する" and "kiに なる".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">What about "kiが する"? Again, the
particle gives us the clue to what's going on.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">When we say "kiが する", it's the "ki",
the spirit itself, that's acting.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">It's not something becoming our
spirit, it's not us turning something into our spirit.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">It's our spirit doing something or a
certain aspect of our spirit acting ("する", do or act).</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">How do we understand this? Well,
again we need to understand something else in Japanese before we
can properly understand this.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">When we use expressions like "ii
nioiが する"or "きれい-na otoが する", what we're saying is "there's a good
smell", "there's a pretty sound/ a pretty sound happened/ a pretty
sound acted".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">What we mean by "する" in the case of
a smell or a sound is the only thing a smell or a sound can do: a
smell smells and a sound sounds.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">When we say "nioiが する", we're saying
that a smell acts, a smell is active, I can detect a
smell.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Otoが する": a sound acts, a sound is
active, I can detect a sound.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">When we say "kiが する", we're saying a
certain spirit, a certain thought, a certain consciousness is
active, I can detect that consciousness, I can detect that
feeling.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So, if we say "damasarete いる you-na
kiが する", we're saying "I've got a feeling we're being deceived,
I've got a feeling we're being tricked"-- such a "ki", such a
feeling, is active.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">If we say "tsuyokuなった kiが する", we're
saying "I feel that I got stronger, I sense that I got stronger"--
that spirit, that inclination of the emotions, of the thoughts, is
active in the same way that a smell is active or a noise is
active.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Now, one last one that I think is
more confusing than the others because essentially it uses a word
in an uncommon way is "kiに いる".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">If we say "sore を kiに いる", we're
saying "I like that".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Now, what we're really saying is
that I'm letting that into my soul.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">What's confusing here is that "いる"
is not being used in its normal way.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"いる"usually means to enter or come
in.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And if we're talking about putting
something into something, we say "ireru".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">But in this case, "いる", probably
because it's an older usage that's cemented into the language in
this particular very common phrase, "いる" actually means allow into
one's spirit.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So, the one who is doing "kiに いる" is
oneself.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And we know that is the case because
that's the way the particles are working.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">We can always trust the
particles.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">If the particles are saying one
thing and the form of the word is saying another, we can be
confident in every case that the particles know what they're
talking about and the word may have changed its meaning over
time.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Kiに いる" is something you'll hear on
various occasions, and a particular characteristic of this is that
it's much easier to use it about other people than things like
"ほしい" or "好き".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">This is not to say that we can
baldly state what other people like and what they don't like, even
using "kiに いる", but if we're going to talk about other people's
feelings, ask them about their feelings, suggest what their
feelings might be, "kiに いる" is much politer than using terms like
"たい" or "好き"or "ほしい".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So you'll very often see "kiに いる" in
references to other people's feelings as well as to one's
own.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So, I hope this makes the whole
"ki"usage a little clearer.</span></p>

comments, please put them in the Comments below and I will answer

<h1 class="c15" id="h.2wdqzeqh2rlc"><span class="c18">Lesson 74:
LOVE and other mysteries of こと!
あなたのことが好き、私のことが嫌い、ということ、そういうこと、どういうこと、そんなこと</span></h1>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">こんにちは.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Today we're going to talk about some
of the mysteries of the word "こと".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And this can indeed be very
mysterious to foreign learners, because some meanings really can't
be translated into English or other languages.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">We can understand them, but we have
to understand them as Japanese concepts.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">One example is when we encounter
expressions like "anata の ことが 好き だ".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Now, I think we all know what this
means in phrase-book terms.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">It means, more or less, "I love
you".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">It's not in fact how we would say
the exact phrase "I love you"in Japanese, which would be "ai してru",
and that's an expression that, while it technically means "I love
you", almost nobody ever uses in Japanese.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">" anata の ことが 好き だ" is fairly
understandable if it were just "anataが 好き だ" ("I like you"), but
actually what we're saying is that I like your "こと".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Now what does that really mean?
Probably the best way to translate it is to say "I like things
about you"or "I like the thing about you".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">In practice it implies that I like
things like your laugh, the twinkle in your eyes, the way you walk,
the way you drink your coffee, your funny little blue hat, and the
implication is that you've become familiar by observation or
proximity with various things about the person and that this has
gradually accumulated into feelings of love.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Now, you can't say that in English
without writing a little essay or a song to somebody, but in
Japanese it's all encapsulated in that "こと".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So what we could say is that "こと" is
very, very agile, more agile than most agile words in
Japanese.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And the concept of linguistic
agility is very, very important and completely neglected in most
language teaching.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">What we can say in an agile way
isn't just a matter of convenience.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">It deeply affects how we express
ourselves and what we're likely to actually say.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Things that can be said in an agile
way in a particular language are the things we're most likely to
actually express and express regularly.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Conversely, the things that a
culture particularly wishes to express are the things that become
agile in a language.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So, if you want to learn more about
agility, please watch my video on the subject.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">The use of "こと" here is less direct,
as textbooks sometimes say.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">It's not just a question of being
less direct.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">It avoids any sense of direct
physicality and it tends to give this whole implication of the
gradual blossoming of love through the understanding of things
about a person.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">This is something that Japanese
wants to express commonly enough that it has made it a very agile
thing to express.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Now, similarly, we may say things
like "私 の ことが kirai らしい" (" that person, or those people, appear to
find my 'こと' dislikeable").</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Why would we say that? Well, a lot
of the reason, I think, is connected with the way of thinking that
also means that we can't directly express someone else's emotions,
which of course is an actual fact that European languages tend to
overlook: the fact that we never actually do know someone else's
feelings or emotions.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Similarly, no one actually knows
anybody else directly.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">We can't really know another
person.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">We can't know the depths of their
being.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">I'm sure many people watching this
assume that I'm a human being pretending to be an
android.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">This is how little we can know about
any other being.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So when we're talking about
something deeper that affects our emotions rather than simple
acquaintance with a person, it really makes no sense talking about
them being reactions to us.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">They're not reactions to us; they're
not reactions to our actual being.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">They're reactions to what they have
observed about our conduct, our appearance, our words.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And that, our "こと", is what they may
either like or dislike.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Now, where there isn't a cultural
factor, "こと"can in some circumstances be much easier to translate
and understand.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So, for example, if we say
"tanaka-san の こと" and we don't have any particular affection for
Tanaka-san, this translates most of the time fairly easily into
things like "the matter of Tanaka-san / the affair concerning
Tanaka-san"or just "the fact that Tanaka-san is a bit of an awkward
person to deal with".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">What we actually mean by "tanaka-san
の こと" will depend on what the hearer knows about the history of
ourselves and Mr.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Tanaka.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So this really isn't very difficult
at all.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">But a lot of people have asked me to
explain expressions like "dou iu こと and "sou iu こと", and I've
touched on these before, so I'll just go over this a
little.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">言う and "こと" in a way belong
together, because a "こと" is a situation, a circumstance, by
implication something that actually requires a bit of
explanation.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And the idea of explanation, the
idea of expression, and the idea of a "こと", I think, have always
been very close in Japanese.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">That's why the kun-reading of the
kanji that we use in 言う, the other kun-reading, the one when it's a
noun, is "こと".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">It's not the same "こと", but as we
know if we know much about Japanese and kanji, there are often
alternative kanji for the same word.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Now, these aren't quite the same
word, but they are related.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And this is why we're always getting
expressions like "sou iu こと", "dou iu こと", "to iu こと", because a
"こと" is something said, something explained, a situation that
requires words.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So the question "dou iu こと" is one
that we often hear.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">It means, in a way, "what kind of
こと?" and "what kind of...", we're taught in Genki and other
textbooks, is "donna"in Japanese, and indeed it is, but we tend to
use "dou iu"more often in cases where either more explanation might
be required or where the explanation would be perhaps a little less
expected.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So, for example, when a character
finds herself in a strange situation or simply doesn't know what's
going on because it's all very strange and unexpected, she's very
likely to say "dou iu こと" -- "what kind of a thing is this? In what
way explained a situation is taking place or has taken place
here?"Similarly, when Katrielle Layton solves the case, she says
"Sou iu こと でした" ("So that's how the situation was
explained").</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And it's thrown into the past tense
because the idea is that she has solved a mystery that is a
standing mystery, in other words, this was the explanation all
along and she's just discovered it.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Now, "sou iu こと"or "dou iu
こと"doesn't have to be something particularly recondite or
difficult, but it tends to imply a greater depth of needed
explanation than a simple "donna".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">On the other hand we do also have
"donna"'s partner "sonna"frequently used with "こと", and in these
cases the implication is often that while the "こと" is relatively
easily understood or explained, we have some kind of a negative
reaction to it.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Now, that could be denial or it
could be protest or disappointment.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So, for example, if somebody praises
us, you may say "sonna ことが ない" (" that's not true!"), because in
Japanese it's polite to reject praise.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And this is so frequent that it's
often reduced simply to "sonna こと"or even just "sonna,
sonna".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So, we're saying that what you've
said, this situation which you're describing about me, is not the
case: I'm not worthy of this praise.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And we'll also often hear characters
or people saying simply "sonna こと"or just "sonna" and the
implication of this is that what is happening is very
unsatisfactory or that what someone has said was a bad or unkind
thing to say.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So, "sonna こと", or more often
"sonna", represents a negative reaction to the
situation.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And it's interesting in that clearly
it's an unfinished sentence.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">You were going to say something
about the "sonna こと".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">But unlike many Japanese unfinished
sentences, this one, this "sonna"of protest, is so lodged into the
language that it's actually difficult to finish the
sentence.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">It's actually difficult to say what
the person might have said if they had finished the sentence,
because it's almost never finished.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Sonna!" has evolved into a protest
against the dreadfulness of something all by itself.</span></p>

<h1 class="c15" id="h.rcuaf1svna3q"><span class="c18">Lesson 75:
Japanese is NOT English: How expression strategies differ | polite
Eihongo=rude Japanese</span></h1>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">こんにちは.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Today we're going to talk about
expression strategies in Japanese that are so different from their
English equivalents that they can cause great difficulty once we
get into the real world of Japanese.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And this difficulty is made much
worse by the way Japanese is taught in conventional textbooks and
websites and the whole "Eihongo"Japanese model, which teaches
Japanese essentially by pretending that it's much more like English
than it is and "dumbing down"Japanese expressions into Eihongo-type
equivalents.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So, let's start with one of the
things that causes the most difficulty because it's something
that's really fundamental to English and doesn't exist in
Japanese.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And that is, pronouns.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">In English, we can't get through a
moderately complex sentence without using pronouns like
"it".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">If we're talking about any kind of
an object, from the Andromeda galaxy to an insect, even a
moderately complex passage about it is going to contain "it"over
and over again.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And this is not how Japanese
works.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">In fact, I'm going to say something
that may seem unduly radical.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">I'm going to say that Japanese
doesn't have simple pronouns at all, not in the sense that they're
understood in English and other European languages.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Now, that may seem a bit extreme,
but let me explain what I mean.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">First of all, let's take the most
basic pronoun, "it".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">There is no equivalent word in
Japanese to "it".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Nowhere in Japanese can you find
anything that corresponds to "it"except zero.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">The only way to say what we mean
when we say simply "it"in English is to say nothing or write
nothing: to use the zero pronoun.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Now, you may say that while we
accept this, surely there are in fact pronouns.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">After all, most textbooks start off
with the pronoun "私".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Almost every basic sentence in a
basic textbook is "私 this, 私 that, 私 the other".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And the ones that aren't are "anata
this, anata that, and anata the other".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So, doesn't Japanese at least have
the basic pronouns "you" and "I"? And the answer to that is "No,
not in the European sense."In the European languages, there is
always one basic, simple pronoun that means "I".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">It is the ego-pronoun: "I"in
English, "ich"in German, "je"in French, "よ"in Spanish.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">There is no equivalent to this in
Japanese.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">There are many ways to say "I": 私,
boku, ore, atai, wagahai.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">All of them are in fact roundabout
ways of referring to oneself.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">When referring to the person you're
speaking to, you can say "anata".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">You can also say: omae, temae,
kisama, kimi, and various other things.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">In other words, this basic personal
pronoun doesn't really exist.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And although we can identify "私" and
"anata" as the most basic of them, it still isn't the same as a
European personal pronoun.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Most of the time we don't use
it.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">All this "私 this, 私 that, 私 the
other"in the textbooks is ridiculously unnatural.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Unless we're trying to stress a
particular point, we don't say this.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">The usual word for "I"is
zero.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">The usual word for "you"is either
zero or the person's name.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">None of the words for "you" that
I've cited above, including "anata", are used all that often
because among other things they're just not very polite.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And it's one of the remarkable
things about the textbooks which cause enormous damage to people's
understanding and grasp of Japanese structure by compelling them to
stick the -ます helper onto the end of verbs and letting them believe
that this is the basic form of verbs, allowing them to believe that
adjectives require a copula when they don't (and if you want to
know more about the damage that です/ます does to our basic grasp of
the language if we learn it before we learn fundamental basic
Japanese, I've done a video on that and I'll put a link above my
head and in the Comments below).</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">The textbooks do this, which is an
extremely destructive thing to do, for the reason that, if you go
to Japan and don't use です/ます to people like your teacher, your
employer or strangers that you meet, they'll think you're
rude.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Now, this is perfectly true, but of
course until you've got a basic grasp of the language you won't be
saying anything to anybody, and if you are, it'll be so inept that
the last thing they're going to be thinking about is whether or not
you're sticking です/ます decorations onto the end of your
sentences.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">But having caused this damage to the
learning of structure by using です/ます, they then proceed to teach
you to address people as "anata", which is actually ruder than not
using で su and -ます.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">If you don't use です/ます and your
Japanese is pretty poor, most people will just assume that you're
like a small Japanese child who doesn't really know the decorations
yet.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">If you call people "anata", even
though they'll cut you some leeway because you're foreign, they'll
probably find it difficult not to wince.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">You don't call your teacher "anata",
you don't call your boss "anata", you don't call strangers "anata",
but even with friends, to whom you don't need to use です/ます, you
don't call them "anata"either.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So why do the textbooks, when they
actually put your grasp of Japanese structure through the wringer
by forcing you to use です/ます too early, then proceed to teach you
something far ruder than not using です/ます? Well, the reason is that
they're prepared to sacrifice anything in order to structure
Japanese as if it were English.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">In English you use the simple,
neutral personal pronoun "you" all the time, and in Japanese you
don't.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">But they seem to think you're too
dumb to get that.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">They seem to think that unless
Japanese sentences are structured in such a way that they sound
unnatural but feel to you like an English sentence, with "私 this, 私
that, anata this, anata that", you won't be able to grasp
it.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So, Japanese doesn't have an "it"
and it doesn't really have a "you"or an "I"in the sense that
European languages do.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">What about " he" and "she"? At least
it has "kare" and "kanojo", doesn't it? Well, "kare" and "kanojo"
were introduced into Japanese in the late Edo and early Meiji era
in order to translate nineteenth-century European novels into
Japanese.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">That's what they were
for.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Since then, they've become
integrated into the language and they're used sometimes in everyday
speech, but not nearly as much as the zero-pronoun is
used.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">For every one time that "kanojo"or
"kare" are used for " he"or "she", there are at least a hundred
times when the zero-pronoun is used in that capacity.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So, what do we do when, for example,
we want to express possession? Suppose we want to say "Sakura and
her dog".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Now, we could say "Sakura to kanojo
の inu".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">That is grammatical Japanese, but
it's not very usual Japanese.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">The usual way of saying it would be
"Sakura to その inu".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And this word "その"is very important
here.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">We're taught, early on, that it
means "that", in the sense of "that dog", "that hat", "that
country", and it does, but as we've learned before, Japanese words
very rarely correspond to the exact same part of the meaning
spectrum that their supposed English equivalents correspond
to.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">If in English we say something like
"that dog"or "that tree" we mean the one we're talking about, the
one related to the current subject.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">But in Japanese it goes considerably
further than this.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So, "Sakura to その inu" means Sakura
and a dog related to her, in other words, Sakura and her
dog.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And this ability of "その" to express
things like possession and relatedness gives rise to a whole range
of strategies.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">But once we understand what it
means, they're much easier to understand.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So, for example, the simple Sanseido
Japanese dictionary defines the word "tachiau", which can't really
be translated into any particular English word because what it
means is go to a particular place in the capacity of a witness or
act in the capacity of a witness.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">The Sanseido definition is "shounin
toしてその baに deru": as a witness, go to that place.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Well, that's the nearest we can get
in English without getting rather convoluted.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">What does "that place"mean here? The
only way to translate that properly into English would be to say
something like "as a witness, go to the place which is whatever
place is involved at the time -- that place, the place to which you
go as a witness".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So this opens up a whole range of
uses of "その" which don't really have any equivalent in
English.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"その"is the related thing, the thing
in question at the time, the thing belonging to the person we're
talking about, or whatever, and this gives strategies that are
essentially the ones that displace English pronouns.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And there are various other
strategies that displace pronouns.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">For example, we've talked in the
past about "くれる" and "あげる", and I think we often get the impression
that this has a lot to do with a more personal sense of
relation.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">We're not just talking about what's
done but whether it's done as a favor to ourselves, whether it's
done as a favor to someone else, and that kind of thing.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And that is important
too.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">But also it takes the place of
pronouns.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">If we said "oshiete kureta", what
we're saying is "she taught me".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">We know that someone else did it,
because the "て くれる"form can only be something done by someone
else.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">We know that they did it to me
because "くれる" means either me or someone within my
circle.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So, we can say "oshiete
kureta".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">There is no "she" and there is no
"me"in that sentence, but the form of the sentence tells us what
the pronouns would tell us in English.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Again, if we say "koroしてやる", it
means "I'll kill you".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And again, it's the "て やる" which
gives us both the "you" and the "I".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And generally speaking, if we use
any plain, non-past action referring to the future the default
actor is going to be "I".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">If we say "ima kaeru", this means
"I'm going home now".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">How do we know it's "I"? Well, first
of all, "I"is the default, and secondly we're predicting an action
which is in our own minds.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">We can't predict the actions of
others except under special circumstances.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So unless the context suggests
otherwise, this has got to be "I": "I'm going home now." and
somewhat related to the use of "その", we have the use of
"ある".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And stories often begin with "aru
hi", and people often wonder why "aru hi".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"ある"simply means "being".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Now, as we know, any verb or any
verbal clause can modify any noun.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So why "aru hi"? "ある"just means
"exist".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So "aru hi" means "existing
day".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Now, when a story begins with "aru
hi", we're saying "One day".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">If we say "aru kuni の aru muraに",
we're saying "In a certain village, in a certain country" and this
is another very usual setting for a story.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">But we're not saying "a certain",
because the expression strategy is different in Japanese from in
English.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">In English we say "a certain..."--
and what do we mean by that? Well, we mean that the place is
certain.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">We know where it is, we know what it
is, we're just not telling you.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Which, when you think about it, is
rather a strange way of putting it.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">The only reason we really say "a
certain..."is that we want to introduce it without saying anything
at all about it.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And Japanese, which is often more
logical than English, does that in the most logical way
possible.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">It doesn't tell us anything about it
except the fact that it exists.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And if it didn't exist, it wouldn't
be there, there'd be nothing to talk about, so we're saying the
absolute minimum we can say, that it exists.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Of course, it may not even exist in
reality, but it exists in relation to the narrative, so it exists:
"aru kuni の aru muraには ..." and just as a rider to this, I'd like
to talk about "aru hi の こと"or even "aru kuni の こと", which again can
introduce a story.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Why are we saying "の こと" here? Well,
it's worth remembering that "こと"not only means a situation or a
circumstance but is a kind of cousin to the "こと"of
"ことba".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">A "こと" is a thing, a circumstance,
something that you can't just see or touch, you need a verbal story
or description to convey it.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So, "aru hi の こと"essentially means
the affair of a certain day.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">" aru mura の こと" means the affair of
a certain village.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And we're saying this to preface the
story.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">We're saying that what follows will
be the affair of a certain day/ the affair of a certain
village.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And because of the kinship to
"ことba", it has a slight overtone of "the story of a certain
village/ the story of a certain day".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So, here we have some expression
strategies that are very different from English ones, difficult to
grasp until we know what they mean, and very difficult to grasp
when we've been misled into thinking that Japanese expression
strategies are much nearer to English ones than they actually
are.</span></p>

The Right Opening? aku, akeru, hiraku, hirakeru | あく、あける、ひらく、ひらける、
開く、開け</span></h1>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">こんにちは.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Today we're going to look at
something that is important in itself but also throws light on some
of the subtleties of Japanese that are very useful to know as we go
forward into deeper immersion.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So, what we're going to look at is
four different ways of saying something that in English are all
covered by the one word "open".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Now, these are "aku", "akeru", "
hiraku", " hirakeru".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Now, when we look at these at first
they look like two self-move/other-move pairs, don't they? And up
to a point they are.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">But what this is going to illustrate
is something of the subtlety of the whole self-move/other-move
concept in Japanese, as opposed to the much more technical and
clear-cut contrast between transitivity and intransitivity in
English and other Western languages.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So, if you're not familiar with the
concept of self-move and other-move verbs (what in the West tend to
get called transitive and intransitive verbs) I'll put a link to my
video on that subject above my head and in the Comments
below.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">The second thing we notice is that
when you write them with kanji, you can't actually see the
difference between "aku/akeru" and " hiraku/hirakeru".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Now this is partly because they are
actually interchangeable in many cases and on the whole if it's not
a case where it really needs to be " hiraku/hirakeru", people will
generally read "aku/akeru".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">But if a writer wants to specify
that she's using " hiraku"for a particular effect (and we'll look
at some of those effects a little later) she will write it in
hiragana to make the matter clear.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Right.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So first let's take the top two,
"aku/akeru".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">" aku"is self-move.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">" akeru"is other-move.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">They both mean "open".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So, "aku": a door opens, a bottle
opens; "akeru": open a door, open a bottle.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">That at least is the
theory.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">In practice, we will often hear
Japanese people say things like "me を aku" (open one's eyes), which
is technically incorrect in the eyes of the grammarians because
"aku"is self-move and they're using it in an other-move way: open
one's eyes.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Now, I'm somewhat challenging the
grammarians here and I'll tell you why in a moment, but you should
stick to the actual grammatical model because there are only a
limited number of instances in which Japanese people do use "aku"
transitively (and I'm using the word "transitively"deliberately
here -- you'll see why in a moment) and you don't want to be
memorizing which those are.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">If you use "akeru" as the other-move
version -- opening your mouth, opening the door, opening anything
-- you'll never go wrong.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">That's always correct.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So why am I challenging this
official view that "aku"ought to be intransitive? Well, I've got a
slight feeling here that Japanese grammarians are a little bit
influenced by Western thinking and by the Western concepts of
transitivity and intransitivity.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">When Japanese people say "me を aku",
I believe the instinct or the feeling behind it is that opening
one's eyes is toward the "ある"side of the "aru/する"map that we talked
about in my transitivity lesson.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">In other words, opening one's eyes
is closer to being self-move, closer to being then doing, as
opposed to opening the door, opening a bottle or some other
external object.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Now, that's my take on this, and you
can ignore it if you want to, but we'll get on to some more of
these subtleties which are not disputed by anybody as we go
forward.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So now let's look at the difference
between "aku" and " hiraku".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">They both mean "open".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">" aku"is officially speaking
self-move, although we can see that there's a little bit of leeway
here; " hiraku"is both self-move and other-move qui
て-formally.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">The difference between them has
nothing to do with self-move or other-move.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">It has to do with the kind of
opening that we're talking about.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So if we talk about opening a
bottle, taking the lid off a box, anything like that, it's
definitely "akeru".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">On the other hand, if we talk about
a flower opening it's definitely " hiraku".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So something that unfolds, opens
out, is " hiraku".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Something that simply becomes open
instead of closed is "aku/akeru".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And if you like Japanese children's
songs, you may well have heard the handがme song that goes "musunde
hiraite te を utte musunde".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Musunde"is "musubu", which means
"gathered or joined" and that refers to a closed hand.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">" hiraite"refers to a hand that's
spread out like an open flower.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Now, there are various areas where
these two are interchangeable, but even when they're
interchangeable they stress one aspect rather than
another.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So, for example, a French door can
"aku" (open) or " hiraku" (spread open).</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Eyes generally "aku", but they can
be said to " hiraku", and when we use " hiraku"instead of "aku"in
these cases it's rather like in a movie when you zoom in on
someone's eyes slowly becoming open or on doors slowly spreading
open.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">There's more sense of the actual
process of the opening, of the spreading out.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So this gives a subtlety that we
don't have in English that can be infused into speech or writing
just by choosing " hiraku"instead of "aku".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Now, when we come to more
metaphorical or abstract uses, the distinction is important
again.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">For example, we can say "mise を
akeru"or "mise を hiraku" and they both mean "open a shop", but
"mise を akeru"implies simply opening in the morning for business or
opening after the lunch break or something like that, simply
literally opening the shop, just opening the doors so the customers
can come in.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Mise を hiraku"implies opening a
shop for the first time, opening to the public.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">In other words, spreading out like a
flower, changing from something that was closed into something
that's open.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And just a side-note here: with an
umbrella, which also spreads out and you might be inclined to say "
hiraku", we don't usually use that, it's generally "sasu"for
opening an umbrella.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Now, what about " hirakeru"? The
Japanese grammarians, or at least many of them, actually designate
" hirakeru" as the self-move version of " hiraku".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">But that doesn't really make any
sense, because " hiraku"itself is both self-move and
other-move.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So what's actually going on here?
This is quite interesting.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">" hiraku", which can be either
self-move or other-move, is further over to the "する"side of the map
than " hirakeru".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And what do I mean by that? Well, I
did a video a while ago about what I call untranslatable
Japanese.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And this is about Japanese verbs
that really can't be reproduced in English because they express
states rather than actions in a way that just doesn't happen in
English.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">A very simple and common example is
"分かる", which is often translated by English dictionaries and
textbooks as "understand".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">It certainly doesn't mean
"understand", but when you get a better translation that will tend
to be "be understandable"or "be clear", and that's much closer to
what "分かる" actually means, but the real meaning can't be translated
into English because it's actually not an adjective like "clear"or
"understandable".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">It's a verb.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So what we're really saying is "do
understandable / do the act of understandability" and this just
doesn't have an English translation.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And there are lots of stative verbs
like this and I talked about them in the video.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And " hirakeru"really comes closer
to being one of these.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Nureru", which is often translated
as "become wet", but it doesn't actually mean "become wet"-- It can
include that but implies "existing in the state of being
wet".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">It may mean "become wet and then
continue to be wet"or it can just mean "be wet", but of course it
isn't "be wet", it's in fact "do wet", which isn't translatable
into English.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">The same with "
hirakeru".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So it's used in cases like, for
example, we often say "unが hirakeru", which means "one's luck
opens".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Now, we could say "unが hiraku", and
that would mean "one's luck unfolds like a flower, becomes open",
but " hirakeru"implies not just unfolding but continuing to exist
in that state of unfoldedness.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">The reason we would be more prone to
say "mise を hiraku"is partly because it's more other-move than "
hirakeru" and we're actually doing it to the shop, we're opening
it; also because stress is on this act of opening the
shop.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Unが hirakeru": the stress on the
actual opening of the luck is less important than the fact that
it's going to change.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">From then on, we're going to be
lucky, whereas at the moment we're not so lucky.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So, I think this gives us a view not
only of the four words for opening in Japanese and how they work,
how they interplay.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">A lot of the time they overlap with
each other and it doesn't matter too much which one you
use.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">In some cases it really is
important, either for what you're specifically saying or for the
nuance and implication and atmosphere that you want to build by
saying it.</span></p>

Real Japanese Structure vs Tae Kim - Structural Review of Tae Kim's
Japanese Grammar</span></h1>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">こんにちは.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Today's is the first video that I've
really hesitated to make and had second thoughts about it, but I've
decided to go ahead.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">It's a video that I think will throw
more light for all of us on the structure of Japanese.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And it'll do this by taking it from
a slightly different angle and contrasting it with something
different from what I normally contrast it with.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Normally, I contrast Japanese with
the conventional "Eihongo"Japanese grammar models.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And some people actually have
criticized me for criticizing those models too much, for repeatedly
pointing out the failings of those models rather than simply
expounding what I have to expound.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And I do this for a reason, and the
reason is this: conventional Eihongo/Western Japanese grammar
really hasn't changed since hundreds of years ago, when Western
people started imposing classical European grammar on the Japanese
language in an attempt to explain it to other Western
people.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And these explanations are enshrined
in the most prestigious places.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">They're taught in universities by
people with strings of letters after their names.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">They're taught in all the standard
textbooks and then echoed down to everybody with a Japanese
learning website or channel.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And because of this, because of the
prestigiousness and the ubiquity of these models, when people hear
other models, they're very likely to wonder how they can reconcile
the two.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">The old models "must" be true
because they're so prestigious and the new model sounds true as
well, so how do we marry them up, how do we reconcile them? And the
answer is of course that we can't actually reconcile
them.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">If 2 and 2 equal 4, then they can't
also equal 5.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And it's necessary to point this out
because people will try to reconcile them if they're not aware of
that, and that's going to lead us into all kinds of logical
tangles.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Now, Tae Kim-先生, whom we're going to
speak about today, was intelligent enough and brave enough to see
the fundamental flaws in the conventional Western Japanese
models.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">He saw that they were full of
contradictions and inconsistencies and illogicalities, and he tried
to create models that were more consistent and more
logical.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">The problem is that in the most
important areas what he essentially did was keep the bits that were
wrong and try to reconcile the bits that were right with
those.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So we ended up with something that
was in many respects worse than the original Eihongo
models.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Now, I want to make it clear that I
am not trying to do any kind of a " hit job"on Tae
Kim-先生.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">I respect him greatly and I
recognize that he was just about the only person (apart from Jay
Rubin) who recognized that there is a problem with conventional
Eihongo Japanese and had the courage to try to do something about
it.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">It's people who recognize the
problems and try to solve them who move knowledge
forward.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And this process of moving knowledge
forward is littered with experiments that didn't work and models
that in the end didn't stand up to testing.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">That doesn't make them
foolish.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;They are part of the path of
knowledge.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Tae Kim-先生 has quite a lot of
information online and a lot of what he says is useful.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">The areas in which we have to
dispute his models are essentially three, and unfortunately these
three are so near to the very core of the structure of the language
that they do cast a shadow over everything else, because they have
logical consequences.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So, the three are essentially: the が
particle, which is the absolute backbone of Japanese structure, the
copula "だ" , which is essential to all non-adjectival A-is-B
structures, and the myth of Japanese conjugation.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So, as you see, this is quite a
formidable threesome that really casts a shadow over
everything.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">However, if we're sufficiently aware
of the problems it could still be possible to use at least some of
Tae Kim's work.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And his approach to immersion itself
is actually closer to what I believe than anything else I've
seen.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So let's look at the three
problems.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">The first is the が
particle.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Now, the が particle, as I've
explained on various occasions before, is the absolute core of
Japanese.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">You can't have a sentence without
the が particle, even though you can't always see it.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">It's sometimes present only as a
logical entity.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">But it's always there, and if we
don't have it, we don't have a sentence.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Simple as that.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">What the が particle does is, it
marks the subject of the sentence, that's to say, the thing that
we're saying something about.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">We're either saying "a is B"or "a
does B".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">What the A-car is is the subject of
the sentence, the be-er or the do-er of the sentence.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">The が particle marks
this.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">It can never mark anything
else.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">But conventional Japanese makes a
mess of this by misunderstanding some Japanese sentences to the
point where it has to say thatが only sometimes marks the subject of
the sentence; other times it marks the object.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Now, this is nonsense and I've
demonstrated that it's nonsense.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">が never marks anything but the
subject.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Tae Kim tries to reconcile this
problem by saying thatが doesn't mark the subject and even going so
far as to say that there is no such thing as a subject in Japanese
and saying that there is a subject is simply imposing European
concepts on the language.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Now, the truth is that every human
language has a subject, which is what we call an A-car, and a
predicate, which is what we call a B-engine.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">All we are saying when we say this
is that every human language can say something about
something.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">It can take a particular thing and
say a particular thing about it.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">The particular thing it takes is
called the "subject".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">The particular thing it says about
it is the predicate.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">It's as simple as that.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">If we don't have subjects and
predicates we don't have language in any developed sense of the
word.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">All we can do, if we can't say a
particular thing about a particular thing, is make noises that
express that we're happy or sad or angry or frightened, just as
animals do.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Without subjects and predicates
there is no language.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Simple as that.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Different languages may deal with
them in very different ways, but the concepts have to be
there.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Now, what is it that induces Tae
Kim-先生 to declare that Japanese is so different from any human
language that it has no subject? Well, ironically, it's the fact
that he can't shake the Eihongo grammar approach that continually
imposes English structure on Japanese.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">It's because they can't conceive
(and apparently Tae Kim-先生 can't conceive either) that the Japanese
could ever take the ego out of the heart of a subjective
sentence.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So, the example he uses to "prove"
that Japanese has no subject is the phrase "クレープが 食べたい" , which of
course in all the textbooks gets translated as "I want to eat
crepes".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And, as usual in English, the
experiencer of the subjectivity, the ego, is placed at the
center.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">That's the subject, that's the doer:
"I want to eat crepes." and of course the crepes are marked by が,
and they're not the subject, are they? Soが isn't marking the
subject.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">On this, Tae Kim-先生 and conventional
Eihongo Japanese are at one.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Eihongo Japanese explains it by
saying thatが only sometimes marks the subject.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Tae Kim-先生 explains it by saying
that there is no subject in the entire language.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">But the simple reason for both these
statements is a complete inability to even consider the fact that
Japanese might use different expressions from English and that it
could be possible to take the ego out of the center of a statement
about subjectivity.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Now, the odd thing about this is we
don't even have to go as far as Japanese to know that this happens
all the time.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">It happens in Spanish.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Me gusta el tequila"is not saying
"I like tequila", although all the textbooks will tell you it
is.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">It's saying "tequila does pleasing
to me".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Now, this may not be the way English
wants to put it, but it is the way Spanish puts it.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"クレープが 食べたい" means "Crepes are eatは
nt-inducing (to me)".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Again, this may not be the way
English wants to put it, but it is the way Japanese puts
it.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">The が particle is doing what it
always does.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">It's marking the subject, the doer,
the A-car, of the sentence.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">It's just that the subject, the
doer, the A-car, of the sentence in Japanese is not the same as it
would be if an English person tried to express the same
sentiment.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">The subject of the sentence is the
crepes.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">They are the one that's doing the
eatは nt-inducing to the experiencer.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And if we understand this we don't
have to say thatが marks the subject some of the time.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">We can see thatが marks the subject
all the time.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And we don't have to start saying
that there's no such thing as a subject in Japanese.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Because the only language in which
there's no such thing as a subject is "wanは n" and "n や n-n や
n"language.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Human language has to have subjects
and predicates or it ceases to be language.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Now, some of you may be asking, how
can I say that my model is the truth? That the whole of
conventional Japanese grammar is not true and Tae Kim-先生, whom I
acknowledge to be a very fine mind, is also producing models that
aren't true? And the answer to that is, I'm not saying that at
all.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">There is no such thing as truth in
language structure or linguistics, just as there is no such thing
as truth in science.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Humans have metaphysical
minds.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">They want narratives and they want
truth and falsehood.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Both of these are inherited from
deep and ancient metaphysical intuitions.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And I'm not saying anything here
about whether those intuitions are true or whether they're
false.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">All I'm saying is, if they're true,
neither science nor linguistics are the places to look for
them.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">If we have a model that is
inconsistent and has to be continually shoehorned with rules and
exceptions to make it work, or we have a model that is too vague to
be very useful, and then we have a model that is precise and
consistent and works all the time, we're likely to say that that
third model is the true one.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">But in fact this is falling into the
metaphysical trap.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">I may occasionally speak that way
myself, but let's be perfectly clear: this is just really a trick
of language.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">When compared to the inconsistent
model or the vague model, the consistent and accurately predictive
model is not "truer", but it is more useful.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Science doesn't tell us
truth.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">It predicts things.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">It tells us that when we do A and B
the result is going to be C.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">This has nothing to do with truth,
metaphysics, narratives or anything else, it's just a method of
prediction.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And if we can predict things, we can
do useful things with those predictions.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">It's exactly the same with
language.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So the conventional model is
sufficiently inconsistent that in many cases it's not fit for
purpose, at least not if we can find a better model to replace it
with.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Tae Kim-先生's answer to this is to
create a model so vague that it's unfalsifiable.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Now, when we talk about models or
theories, being falsifiable may sound like a negative, but it's
not.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">It's a positive.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Because if there are no
circumstances under which a theory can be falsified, then
essentially it doesn't really mean anything.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Theories work by defining phenomena;
that's to say, setting out their limits: setting out the conditions
under which they apply and the conditions under which they don't
apply.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">If we create one that applies under
all possible conditions, then it really doesn't mean
anything.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">If you give me an object and ask me
what it is, if I say it's a marble, or it's a box, or it's a twig,
you can verify or falsify that statement.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">If I say it's an object, you can't
falsify it, because everything is an object, but on the other hand,
I haven't told you anything worth knowing.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">What Tae Kim does with the が
particle is call it the "identifier particle".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Now, if you went a bit further, that
might be useful.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Does it identify the subject? Does
it identify the object? Does it identify some completely different
kind of category? And the answer is, we're not told.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">All Tae Kim-先生 has to tell us is
that it indicates that the speaker wants to identify something
unspecified.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Now, this vagueness might be
considered not very destructive, but in fact it is very destructive
because it essentially takes away our ability to define
anything.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">We can't see how the core Japanese
sentence works because we don't have the が particle.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">We can't talk about the difference
between logical and non-logical particles, like the は and も topic
markers, because we don't have the key logical particle.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">If we have to build a theory around
this undefined が, then we're going to have a very undefined kind of
theory.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So we've essentially created a
structure that negates the core structure of Japanese from the
beginning.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And once we've done that, we
logically find ourselves having to do other things that take the
theory even further from being useful and predictive.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So in our next lesson we're going to
look at what happened to the "だ" copula in Tae Kim-先生's theory and
some other consequences.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Now, once again, I'm not trying to
denigrate Tae Kim-先生.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">In fact, the reason I've singled him
out is because he's the only person who's really challenged the
conventional Eihongo model at a deep enough level to give us
another perspective, another angle for assessing Japanese
structure.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And it's really only because he's
that important and that intelligent that I made the difficult
decision to make this video and the next one.</span></p>

Breaking the Core: Tae Kim vs the Copula | Japanese Structure-Based
Critical Review</span></h1>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">こんにちは.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Today we're going to talk about the
core of Japanese structure and we're going to look at it from a
different angle by contrasting it to something different from what
we normally contrast it to.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And that is, we're going to look at
what Tae Kim-先生 does with it.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Last week we looked at what Tae
Kim-先生 does with the が particle, which is the absolute core and
center of every logical Japanese sentence.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Today we're going to look at what he
does with "だ".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And in a way this is parallel to
what he does with が.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">That is to say, he essentially
vagues it out of existence, takes away its logical function and
gives it a vague kind of function.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Now, why does he do this? Again,
essentially for the same reason: because the conventional Eihongo
grammar interpretation is a bit of an illogical mess and Tae Kim-先生
wants to tidy it up.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">But essentially once again what he
does is take the part of it that's wrong and try to reconcile the
part of it that's right with that.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So we end up with something that's
actually more damaging and less useful than the Eihongo mishmash we
had in the first place, which at least had some of the actual
structure of Japanese in it, even if in a rather illogical and
messy way.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And he also denies that "だ" and "です"
are actually the same thing, and this is really for three
reasons.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Firstly, if you deny the copula
function it doesn't really much matter what they are.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Secondly, "です"is a little bit
eccentric.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">It does one thing that "だ" doesn't
do.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;Just one thing.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">But also because the Eihongo
Japanese model is so confusing and so wedded to the myth of
so-called "Japanese conjugation", which doesn't exist, that it
makes that one eccentricity of "です"look like more than
one.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">It looks as if it's all over the
place when in fact it's only got one eccentricity -- which is a
little bit confusing, but when you see it for what it is, it's just
that one thing.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So, how important is it that we
misunderstand the "だ" copula? It's not central to every Japanese
sentence the way the が particle is, so is it that bad? Well, as a
matter of fact it is, because it takes away another of the absolute
pillars of understanding Japanese structure.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And that is, understanding the three
engines and the three core sentences.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">There are only three ways a logical
Japanese sentence can end: with a verb, an adjective, or a noun
plus copula.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">It can't end with a noun on its own;
it can only end with a noun plus copula.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And this is fundamentally important
and we'll get to why in just a moment, but I'll just note here that
part of the reasoning behind Tae Kim saying that the copula is a
mere declarative -- it doesn't actually do anything logical and
grammatical, it just emphasizes what we have to say -- is because
in casual speech "だ" sometimes gets dropped.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Now, the important thing to
understand here is that this does not mean that it's
unnecessary.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">In English we often say things like
"Got up early this morning", "Fancy a cup of coffee?", "Call that a
rabbit? Looks more like a teddy bear in a rabbit suit to me!" and
in all these cases we know, everybody knows, that the sentences
aren't fully grammatical.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">You have to say, "I got up early
this morning", "Do you fancy a cup of coffee?", "Do you call that a
rabbit? It looks more like a teddy bear in a rabbit suit to me!"
this is perfectly natural.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">All languages drop necessary
grammatical elements when they can be readily understood by the
[listener] in very casual speech.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">You can't do it in an essay or in
formal writing or in a legal document or anything like that, but
you can do it in casual speech.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">In Japanese, not only does the
copula get dropped, half the particles can get dropped in very
casual speech.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And I don't think anybody argues
that they aren't necessary.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So, in actual grammatical Japanese
you can only end a sentence in one of those three ways.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">It can end with a verb, it can end
with an adjective, or it can end with the copula, and the copula
always has to be attached to a noun, because that's how the copula
works.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And as we know, what the copula does
is tell us that A is B.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"さくらが 日本人 だ" means "Sakura is a
Japanese person".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">It only works one way
around.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">A Japanese person is not necessarily
Sakura.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Sakura is a Japanese
person.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">That's what we're being told by a
copula sentence.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Now, if we look at all the elements
in Japanese, all the verbal elements, there aren't very
many.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Unlike English, unlike European
languages, there really are very few.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">There are verbs, adjectives and the
copula, and then, aside from that, we have nouns -- nearly
everything that's not a verb or an adjective is a noun.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">There are also particles, and there
are some conjunctions like "nara" and "keredo".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Almost everything else that isn't a
verb or an adjective is in fact a noun.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">There are a few exceptions but not
very many.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Now, why are we dividing them up in
this way? On the one side we have verbs, adjectives and the copula;
on the other side we have nouns, particles and
conjunctions.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">The reason is that when we split
them up this way, apart from the fact that we have the three
engines together, the three engines have another characteristic,
another quality.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">They are all "yougen", they are all
transforming verbal elements, that's to say, they can all change
grammatically.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">They don't change as much as
conventional Japanese or Tae Kim-先生 would have us
believe.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">They don't conjugate.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">But they do change the last kana (in
a couple of cases a little more than the last kana) and then, in
the case of verbs and adjectives, they can attach helper verbs,
helper adjectives, and helper nouns.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And this is a fundamental basis of
the way Japanese works.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">In the other column we have nouns,
particles and conjunctions, and these never change.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">A noun never changes
grammatically.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">It never has any kind of
transformation or modification made for grammatical
purposes.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Particles never change.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">They attach to nouns but they always
stay the same.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Conjunctions, like から and "keredo",
don't change their form for grammatical purposes.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">The only verbal elements that do
that in Japanese are the three engines: verbs, adjectives and the
copula.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">But if you look at the conventional
Japanese grammar textbooks and websites you don't end up knowing,
for the most part, that the copula is one of these grammatically
transforming elements.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">We know that the verbs
are.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">We know that the adjectives
are.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">We know that "だ" can actually move
into the past tense and become "だった", but we don't realize that
it's a fully, slightly limited, but a modulating
element.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">The fact that we know that it has
one modulation just makes the whole thing more
confusing.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">It looks like an oddity.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">But it isn't an oddity.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Just like verbs and adjectives, the
copula is a fully transforming element.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">It has a て-form, just like verbs and
adjectives.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And that て-form is "で", and it's the
same て-form whether it's the "だ" version or the
"です"version.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And it has a connective form, which
is used when it's going before the noun it modifies rather than
after the noun it modifies.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">We can say, "女の子は きれい だ" (the girl
is pretty), or we can say "きれい na 女の子".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And when we turn it around this way,
the "だ" has become "na".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">If we want to chain two adjectival
nouns together, we use the て-form of the copula.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And this is just the same as what we
do with adjectives.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">If we want to say "Sakura is small
and pretty", we say "さくらが chiisakute きれい だ".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">If we want to say, "Sakura is pretty
and small" (pretty, "きれい", is a noun, an adjectival noun -- we know
it's a noun because it can be written with all kanji and anything
that's written with two or more kanji and almost everything that's
written with one kanji is always a noun), we say "さくらが きれい de
chisaii".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">If we want to say "Sakura is genki",
we say "さくらが 元気 だ".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">If we want to say "Sakura is genki
and pretty", we say "さくらが genki de きれい だ".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And you see we've done exactly what
we do with adjectives.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">With adjectives, if we want to chain
two adjectives together, we put the first one into the て-form:
"さくらが chisakute kawaii."If we want to chain two adjectival nouns
with their attached copula together, we turn the first copula into
its て-form, which is "で".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Now, for some reason the textbooks
never explain this.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">They try to tell us that adjectival
nouns are some weird thing called a "na adjective" that has this
thing called "na"stuck onto it for no reason that we can possibly
understand, even though when it comes at the end of a sentence it
has "だ" like any other noun.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And then, when we want to chain two
together, most people, I think, seriously believe that the で
particle, for no possible explicable reason, is used for this
purpose.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Of course, it's not the で particle;
it's the て-form of the copula "だ" or "です".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And I think it's the fact that this
is never explained that allows Tae Kim-先生 to believe that "だ" is
simply a declarative.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">If it was a declarative, why would
it need a て-form? Why would you need a て-form on what's essentially
just a verbal exclamation mark? Why would you need a soft
connective form on what's essentially just a verbal exclamation
mark? You wouldn't.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">But because conventional Eihongo
Japanese never makes it clear to us that this is what's actually
happening, that "na"is the pre-connective form of "だ" , that "で"in
these cases is the て-form of "だ" the copula, because it never
explains that, it makes it possible for even someone as intelligent
as Tae Kim-先生 to misconceive what "だ" actually is and what it
actually does.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And having done that, we've really
lost our grasp of the three fundamental engines of every Japanese
sentence.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And I should say that "だ" and "です"
aren't in fact the only two forms of the copula in modern
Japanese.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">They're the most common forms, but
there are also two others.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Sometimes we use "dearu", which is a
bit of a fossil.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">It's an old form of the copula and
it's used in formal but not necessarily polite contexts.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So it can be used for example in
newspaper reporting where it's just being formal and objective, not
particularly polite.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">The famous novel "I Am a Cat"is, in
Japanese, "wagahaiは 猫 dearu", and the reason it uses "wagahai"for
"I" and "dearu"for the copula conveys in Japanese, in a way that
the English translation can't convey, the character of the cat in
question, who has the personality of a rather "erasou", a rather
self-important gentleman who refers to himself as "wagahai" and
uses the rather archaic and formal but not particularly polite
copula "dearu".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">The other copula that we'll hear
often is "degozaiます", and that's ultra-polite.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">It's keigo, and you'll have this
used to you in Japanese hotels and places like that.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">All of them are forms of the copula,
and all of them have the same て-form, "で", and the same connective
form, "na".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Now, the other thing, I think, that
makes it possible to imagine that "です"is not the same copula as "だ"
is that "です" and "ます" are both a little bit eccentric -- and I've
made a whole video on this.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And it's for this reason, because
their eccentricities actually disrupt our grasp of fundamental core
Japanese grammar -- once we've got used to it it's easy enough to
add "です" and "ます"on, but it's best to leave them alone at first
because they do things that no other modern Japanese words
do.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And a thing that "です"does in this
case is that it can be added to adjectives.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So we say "女の子が kawaiい
です".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Now, this "です"is not acting as a
copula.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">It's simply a formality
marker.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And the reason it's there is because
there isn't a formal version of the adjective engine.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And it only happens in this one
case, and it only happens because adjectives don't have another way
of formalizing themselves and somehow Japanese settled on this idea
of using the formal copula as a formality marker in that particular
case.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">The other, non-poli て-forms of the
copula, "だ" and "dearu", are not put onto the end of
adjectives.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And of course it's not just a
question of adjectives.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">The connective form of the copula
and the て-form of the copula are used in various places in Japanese
to form a variety of different constructions.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And I've included some of these in a
video that I'll link above my head and in the information section
below if you'd like to follow it up a bit.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And if we don't know that the copula
has a て-form, or a connective form, then we're going to have a lot
of difficulty in understanding what these constructions are
actually doing.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And if we follow the conventional
Eihongo Japanese grammar we probably won't know this, and if we
follow Tae Kim-先生 we won't even know that there is a
copula.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And this is going to make all kinds
of constructions extremely difficult.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And we should really touch here on
the other problem with Tae Kim, which is not actually worse than
the Eihongo textbooks, but it's no better.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And that is that he, like them,
accepts the myth of "Japanese conjugation".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">He believes that Japanese verbs
conjugate, when all they actually do is change one kana and attach
helper nouns, verbs and adjectives.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And that becomes important in this
particular case because it makes it appear that this eccentricity
of "です"covers a wider range than it really does.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">If I say that "です"is only used as an
empty formality marker on adjectives, someone who is following
either conventional Japanese or Tae Kim may say "well, it's not
only adjectives.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">It also happens to conjugated verbs,
like for example '食べない です' or '食べたい です'.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">They're not adjectives, are they?
They're conjugated verbs." and the answer to that is, of course,
yes, they are adjectives.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">They're not conjugated
verbs.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">There are no conjugated verbs in
Japanese.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"ない" is a helper adjective that is
attached to the stem of "食べる".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">" tai"is another helper adjective
that is attached to the stem of "食べる".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And I've explained all this in my
video about the Japanese stem system.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">These helpers look like adjectives,
they function in every way like adjectives, and there's a good
reason for it.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">They are adjectives.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So, the empty formality marker
version of "です"does not attach to all kinds of different
words.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">It only attaches to one kind of word
and that is adjectives.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And this indicates to us how one
logical error in Japanese actually feeds into others.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Because we don't understand that the
copula modulates, it can feed into a much greater error: that there
isn't a copula at all.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Because we don't understand the
stem-and-helper system and believe that Japanese verbs conjugate,
we can believe that the empty formality marker "です"is used in a
wide range of different situations when in fact it's only used in
one situation.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Now, as I've said before, I'm not
trying to attack Tae Kim-先生.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">He's done a great deal of
exceptional work and the fact that he's misconceived a lot of
Japanese is essentially because he's seen what's wrong with
conventional Eihongo Japanese grammar and tried to tidy it
up.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Unfortunately, instead of sweeping
it into the trash can, he's swept it onto the living room
carpet.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">But that isn't because he's
illogical.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">It's because he's logical and he
just didn't get exactly what was going on.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And that's not surprising, because
nobody's teaching it, nobody's telling anybody.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So I hope I've helped to set things
a little bit straight here.</span></p>

<h1 class="c15" id="h.jmzst39bsjz8"><span class="c18">Lesson 79:
1/3 of all Japanese sentences cracked! Deeper secret of the copula.
+The Tae Kim fallacy</span></h1>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">こんにちは.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Today we're going to talk about
something that's absolutely crucial to the core structure of
Japanese.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">We've talked about this recently in
relation to Tae Kim-先生 and the way he disrupts our understanding of
this particular thing.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">What it is is the copula, and this
really governs an awful lot of what we can say and communicate in
language itself.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">It's crucial to how we conceptualize
the world.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Now, Tae Kim never actually uses the
cをrd, "copula", and that's a large part of the problem.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">But some people may be asking not so
much why Tae Kim doesn't, as why I do.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">After all, I try to avoid technical
linguistic and grammatical terminology as far as
possible.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">I don't often use the word
"grammatical subject"; I even less often use the word
"predicate".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">I prefer to say "a-car" and
"b-engine".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">That way we all know what we're
talking about.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So why do I use this abstract and
rather horrible word, "copula"? Well, the reason is that English
doesn't have a dedicated copula, so it can be quite difficult for
English speakers to grasp exactly what a copula is.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">I have to introduce that function as
something in itself.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">When Tae Kim talks about copular
expressions, he refers to them as "state-of-being"expressions, and
this really is the key to the whole problem.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So, what is the copula, and why does
English not have a dedicated copula, and why does it matter so
much? Let's start off with "what is a copula?" the simplest way of
defining a copula is that it is a oneは y equals sign.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">It tells us that A is B, although B
is not necessarily A.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So, "Sakuraは 日本人 です".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Sakura is a Japanese person; a
Japanese person is not necessarily Sakura.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Now, that is the simple
explanation.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">But if we go a little deeper, what
the copula actually does is place things in sets.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Sakuraは 日本人 です" means that Sakura
belongs to the set "Japanese person".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And this is fundamentally important
for language, which is the tool humans use to conceptualize the
world, the things they see about them, the visible and perceptible
universe.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Placing things into categories is
our most fundamental way of dealing with them.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">A rose belongs to the set
"flower".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Flower belongs to the set "growing
things".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Growing things belongs to the set
"living things".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Living things belongs to the set
"things".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">All the time we are placing things
into sets, and that's the way we conceptualize them.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">We could say very little about
anything if we weren't able to place things into sets.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So this, fundamentally, is what the
copula does.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">It gives us a very simple,
straightforward, unfussy way of putting anything into a set at any
time, of defining at any time the set to which something
belongs.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Now, the set may only be a set of
one.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">In that case the equals sign works
both ways.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So, for example, if I say "that
person over there is Sakura", well, that particular person over
there and Sakura are the same person.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Sakura is a set of one to which that
person over there, and that person over there only,
belongs.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">At least, this particular
Sakura.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">We're not talking about all people
called Sakura, obviously.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So this is what the copula
does.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;Why so much confusion about
it? Isn't it a relatively simple function? Well yes, it is a simple
function.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">The main problem here, as very often
with Western misconceptions of Japanese, lies not in Japanese but
in the nature of the English language itself.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">English, as I said, doesn't have a
dedicated copula.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">It does have a copula.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Every language has to have a
copula.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">If we didn't have something that
performed the copular function, we just wouldn't be able to put
things into sets, which means that we would be very limited in our
ability to conceptualize things.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So what English does is that it
doubles up the verb of being with the copula.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">The verb of being is something that
simply tells us that something exists.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">It has various forms: "is / am / are
/ was"etc.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So, if we say "I am an American",
that's the copula at work.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">We're saying I belong to the set
called "american people".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">If we say "I think, therefore I am",
we're using the verb of being.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">We're not saying anything about what
I am, what set I belong to.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">We're simply saying that because I
think, we can state confidently that I exist.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Now, because English does not have
two separate words for those two concepts, it doesn't actually
cause much trouble to native speakers of English or to foreign
speakers who have learned English at least partly through
immersion, because after a while it all becomes clear through usage
and experience, but it does cause trouble when English tries to
look at languages that have a separate copula.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Japanese obviously is one of these,
and Spanish is another.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">The Spanish language has two
copulas, "ser" and "estar": "ser", which tells us the permanent set
to which something belongs, and "estar", which tells us the
relatively temporary set to which something belongs.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">That's a distinction that most
languages don't make.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">But the important distinction here
is that "ser" and "estar" are not the same as " haber", which is
the verb of being.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So if we say "estos son huevos",
we're saying "these are eggs"; if we say " hay huevos", we're
saying "eggs exist"-- two entirely different kinds of
statement.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">As I say, in English we don't get
confused between those two kinds of statement, but when we try to
apply English explanations to languages that do have different
words for the copula and the verb of being, confusion often
ensues.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Now, some of the people who
commented on my video on Tae Kim versus the copula were not
entirely convinced by my argument that "です" and "だ" are the same
thing, because Tae Kim argues so strongly that they
aren't.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">I think I disposed of most of
them.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">I didn't dispose of all of them
because I wasn't trying to be exhaustive.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And I'm not going to deal with those
arguments here either, because I think they're
peripheral.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">I will in fact be dealing with them
in a video in the fairly near future, but the point here is that
taking arguments like "da isn't necessarily needed in this case but
です is" as a way of sustaining the larger argument that "だ" and "です"
are not the same thing is taking the whole thing upside down and
inside out.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">What's important is not that "だ" and
"です"function a little differently in this way or that way, that "だ"
can be dropped here and "です"can't be dropped there, things like
that.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">They're entirely peripheral to the
issue of the fact that they are both the copula.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And the fundamental argument against
this fallacy is simply this: we know that every language needs to
have a copula.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Without a copular function, you
can't say half of the things that language absolutely needs to
say.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">You don't have a real
language.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">You have a broken language if you
don't have any copular function.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Now, Japanese sometimes speaks in
teineigo (in です/ます speak) and sometimes speaks in straightforward,
plain Japanese.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">The copula in one is "です"; the
copula in the other is "だ".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Now, if you're going to argue that
they're not the same thing, therefore that one of them is not the
copula, then you have to come up with what the copula is, in either
plain language or teineigo (です/ます language), because both of them
have to have a copula.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">You have no language without a
copula, so it's incumbent on you, if you're saying that they're not
the same thing, to tell us where the copula lies in both those
forms of speech.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And of course Tae Kim never tackles
this problem because he doesn't really seem to understand that
there is a copula as opposed to what he calls "the state of
being".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Now, another thing that people may
raise is they may say, "well, surely it isn't just an accident that
English uses the state of being to mean the copula.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Aren't the two things somewhat
closely related? After all, in older forms of the Japanese copula,
like 'de aru' and 'de gozaiます', the state of being plays a
role.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">'Aru' and 'gozaiます' are state of
being words even though the 'de' changes them to copula." and the
answer to that is absolutely yes.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And the reasons for this lie in the
human perception of ontology, that's to say, the science or
philosophy of being itself.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Humans tend to believe that the set
a thing belongs to is fundamental to its being.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And in a sense that's certainly
true.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">We define something by the set it
belongs to, and its existence as the being it is, as opposed to any
other being, is fundamentally tied up in the set to which it
belongs.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">A rose belongs to the set
"flower".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Once we know that, we can guess all
sorts of things about it.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">We may not know exactly what it
looks like, but we can say that it probably has a stem, has petals,
has leaves, grows in the earth, etc.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">etc.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So the set something belongs to is
crucial to its existence as that particular being and not another
being.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">But understanding that the state of
being and the set to which something is attributed are related
semantically doesn't mean that we ought to confuse the
two.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">When we say "I am an American", we
do not mean the same thing by "am" as we do when we say "I think,
therefore I am."If we believe that the Japanese copula, which is
expressed by "だ" or "です", and the state of being, which is
expressed by "いる"or "ある", are in fact the same, we've simply lost a
fundamentally important distinction in Japanese.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Of course, Tae Kim-先生 doesn't
believe that, but at the same time he has great difficulty in
clarifying what the distinction is, and that's how we can end up
thinking that "だ" and "です" are not the same thing.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">There are a few cases where "だ" can
be dropped, sometimes grammatically, sometimes ungrammatically,
which do not apply to "です", that's true, but they don't affect the
fact that they're both the copula.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">There's one case where "です"is used
where it doesn't function as a copula, and that is the case of
adjectives.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">As I demonstrated in that previous
video, adjectives are the one case where "です"is used and it's not
the copula, it's just an empty formality marker.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">But there's another point that we
have to consider here, and that is that while in those cases --
that's to say, in the case of adjectives and no other case (it only
happens in the case of adjectives as I demonstrated in that video)
-- while in the case of adjectives it's true to say that "です"is an
empty formality marker, it's not just a random empty formality
marker.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">As we know, there are only two kind
of sentences, A-is-B sentences and A-does-B sentences, and in
Japanese there are two kinds of A-is-B sentences, that is,
adjective sentences, that in their simple form have to end in -i,
and copular sentences, which have to end in "だ" or "です".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So what's happening when we put
"です"on the end of an adjective sentence is that we're doubling the
copular.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Saying "Sakuraは kawaiい です"is like
saying "Sakura is cute is".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Saying "ペンが 赤い です"is essentially
saying "Pen is red is".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">We're doubling that
copular.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So while "です"is an empty formality
marker, it's not just a random formality marker.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">It's doing something that is
sometimes done in languages, and that is, acting as a redundancy --
saying the same thing twice.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And that's the only actual case
where "です"does something different from "だ".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">If you have any questions or
comments, please put them in the Comments below and I will answer

<h1 class="c15" id="h.504243uq511p"><span class="c18">Lesson 80:
Understand Japanese Even When they Leave Bits Out! Dropped
particles & casual omissions</span></h1>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">こんにちは.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Once we start seriously immersing in
and consuming actual Japanese material, often colloquial and
casual, not textbook Japanese, one of the problems that many people
encounter is the idea that -- "Good heavens, they leave out half of
what they're going to say! They're omitting this and leaving out
that, and how are we supposed to guess what they're actually
talking about?"Now, this isn't nearly as much of a problem as it
can seem at first, but we need to know what's going on and what to
look for.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So, first of all let's talk about
omission in language.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">There are fundamentally two kinds of
omission in language: legal omission and illegal
omission.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Legal omission is when it's
perfectly grammatical within the terms of a particular language to
leave something out.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">This happens in English.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">For example, if we say in English
"the night we met", that's considered a grammatical
phrase.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">What we actually mean is "the night
that we met".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And in French or Spanish you can't
do that.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">You can't leave out that "that",
which is "que"in French or Spanish.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">But in English you can.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">In English it's part of the rules of
English grammar that that everybody's going to understand what you
mean and you're allowed to leave it out.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">You can do it in an academic paper
or a legal document.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">You can do it anywhere.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">It's not ungrammatical.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">It's not an illegal
omission.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">It's a legal omission.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Now, this happens in Japanese, and a
very, very common example, of course, is the zero
pronoun.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">If we say "tsukareta", which is
"tired", we mean "I am tired", and this is a hundred percent legal,
grammatical Japanese.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">You can use it in an academic essay
or a legal document or anywhere.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">It's understood as perfectly
grammatical Japanese.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">There's no question about what you
mean by it.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Firstly because the zero pronoun
always defaults to "I" and secondly because Japanese, as we know,
is very strict in saying that we can only talk about things we are
actually capable of knowing.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So we can't talk about someone
else's state of emotions.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">We can't talk about someone else
liking or disliking something.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">We can only say that they appear to
like or dislike it.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And we can't say that someone else
is tired.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So "tsukareta"can only mean "zeroが
tsukareta / 私が tsukareta".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So this is legal
omission.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">But there's also a lot of illegal
omission that goes on in all languages, and in casual speech as
opposed to very formal speech it's completely legal.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So strictly speaking it's illegal,
but in terms of ordinary, everyday, casual speech, it's
legal.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So what kinds of accepted but
strictly illegal omission are there? Fundamentally, three
kinds.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">The first is when we leave out bits
of words or phrases.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So, for example, instead of "している"
(am doing / is doing) we say "してru"; instead of "してoku" (do and put
in place) we say "shitoku".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Now, these are such regular
illegalities that they're really no different from saying
"shouldn't"or " hadn't"in place of "should not"or " had not"in
English.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">You can use them almost anywhere,
but not in the most formal circumstances.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">A little bit further down the scale,
we have things like saying "wakannai"instead of "wakaranai", or
"tsumannai"instead of "つまらない".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So that's one type, and although it
may take a little while to get used to the expressions, once you
know them they're no more difficult than anything else.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">The other thing that gets left out a
lot is anything that attaches to a noun.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">As I've said before, Japanese is a
very noun-centered language.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And, as you know, nouns always have
something stuck to them: a logical particle to tell us what role
they play in the sentence, sometimes a non-logical particle, and
sometimes a copula.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Now, just about all of these can be
dropped at some time.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">If it's clear without the marker
what role a noun is playing in the sentence, we can in casual
speech, not in formal speech, but in casual speech, we can leave
off that marker.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">The markers that get left off most
often are が, を, and the non-logical topic marker は , and also the
copula "だ".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So, for example, if I say "私
andoroido", I've left off what would probably have been a は after
my name.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">I've also left off "だ" after
"andoroido".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Now, if you know that I'm
introducing myself or saying something about myself, there's no
doubt about what's going on here.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And...</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">I don't want to go back too much to
the subject of Tae Kim-先生, I've done a three-part series about the
things Tae Kim-先生 teaches that he actually shouldn't be teaching,
and I'll link to that, but what I will do here is make a point that
I didn't make there which is that Tae Kim-先生 says that because "だ"
is often dropped and "です"is not dropped, they're not really the
same thing, they're not both the copula.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And I've dealt with this at length
and I've explained what a mess it makes of Japanese if you ignore
the copula, so I won't go over that again.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">But the point I do want to make here
is that the reason that "だ" can be dropped in places where
"です"can't are twofold.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">First of all, why can "だ" be dropped
as often as it is? Well, if the textbooks taught us the basic
structure of Japanese, it would be obvious, but of course they
don't.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">The most basic thing about Japanese
structure is that a Japanese sentence can only end in one of three
ways.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And I think you know what those
three ways are, don't you? Let's say it together.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">A Japanese sentence can only end
with a verb, an adjective, or a noun-plus-copula.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Now, once we know that, we know why
the copula can get left off very easily.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">As I said before, particles and the
copula get left off where it's obvious what the nouns were without
marking them.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">That's when they get left
off.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Now, if a noun comes at the end of
the sentence, we know that it's not a verb sentence.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">We know that it's not an adjective
sentence.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">We know that it's a noun-plus-copula
sentence.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And since we know that, we can, if
we want to, drop the copula.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And this, I think, is why Tae Kim-先生
gets lured into saying that "だ" is a declarative, a sort of verbal
exclamation mark.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">What he's saying is that people use
"だ" when they want to stress what they're saying.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Well, there's a certain amount of
truth in that because the fact is that you can in casual speech
always drop the copula and still be understood, so if you're
speaking at the kind of casual level where you probably would be
dropping it, then when you include it is when you want to stress
what you're saying.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">It's not really as simple as that,
because a lot of people don't drop it, not everybody drops it all
the time.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">It's a bit more complex than that,
but the idea that it is a declarative at least has that grain of
truth in it that because you can drop it pretty much whenever you
want to in casual speech, you often include it because you want to
stress it.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So if it's easy to drop the copula
when it's "だ" , why isn't it easy to drop it when it's "です"? Tae
Kim-先生 turns this into a whole argument for the fact that "だ" and
"です" are two different things, but if you think about it it's
perfectly obvious why "だ" does get dropped (I've explained that
already) and why "です"doesn't.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"です"doesn't get dropped because it's
formal speech.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">In the first place, we drop less in
formal speech.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">We don't drop as many things in a
formal sentence as we do in an informal sentence.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">But even if we're speaking formal
speech at a loose level, where we can be dropping things out of the
sentence, we won't drop the "です".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Why not? Because there's only one
thing that makes teineigo (です/ます level speech) into teineigo, and
that's the fact that we add the "ます" helper verb to the end of verb
sentences and the "です"copula to the end of noun-plus-copula
sentences and even, redundantly, to the end of adjective
sentences.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So you can't in teineigo drop the
"です" without dropping the teineigo.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">It's as simple as that.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Now, there are various rules about
when you can and can't drop things like を out of a casual
sentence.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">You can in theory drop something
whenever it isn't needed.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">In practice there are places where
it seems natural and other places where it doesn't seem
natural.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">If you want to know the rules for
it, sometimes they're very complex and even when they're very
complex they don't necessarily work all the time.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">But you don't need to know
that.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Why don't you need to know it? Well,
let's think about this.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">You need to know that they can be
dropped and you need to know that they're dropped in places where
you can actually work out what they were going to be.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Once you know that, you're not
swimming in an ocean of strange vagueness where things get dropped
and you've no idea what they are.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">What you don't need is to be able to
reproduce very casual Japanese in exactly the way that Japanese
people do it.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And that's the only reason you'd
need to learn these strange lists of rules.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">If you just use all the particles
all the time, occasionally, especially when you're speaking casual
Japanese, your Japanese will sound a bit stilted.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Well, what about that? Language
spoken by foreigners usually does sound a little bit stilted,
doesn't it? You've probably noticed that in English.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">If you're going to be using Japanese
a lot, gradually, bit by bit, you'll get used to the places where
you can naturally drop things.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">If you're not going to be using
Japanese a lot, why do you want to sit down and learn a bunch of
rules in order that you can pretend that you've naturally acquired
Japanese when not only haven't you, but you've no intention of
doing so? So my advice to you is learn Japanese
naturally.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Don't try to memorize sets of rules
when all they could possibly do is make you seem as if you're more
used to Japanese than you actually are.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">But in practice they're not even
going to do that, because you will make mistakes.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">The important thing to understand is
how things get dropped in Japanese, why they get dropped in
Japanese, and how to understand them when they have been
dropped.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">The other kind of thing that gets
dropped, the third category of things that get dropped, are
essentially entire clauses.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">People often end a sentence with a
て-form or a "because"or a "but"kind of ending.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And what they're doing on these
occasions is leading into a second clause that would add some more
information but they're not stating that clause.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And that can serve a variety of
purposes.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">It can hint at something they don't
want to say.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">It can hint at something that they
think is too obvious to need to be said.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Or it can be used just to soften the
thing you're saying right now or perhaps to strengthen it a
bit.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">I've talked about this in other
places and I'll link to the places where I've done that.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">But these are the fundamental
principles of omission in Japanese, and once you know them, the
whole thing becomes much less puzzling.</span></p>

At last! The TOTAL structure of Japanese! Global principle of all
Japanese word-forms. Lesson 81</a></span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">こんにちは.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Today we're going to talk about
something we've never talked about before, which is the overall,
global, cosmic structure of Japanese.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">We've touched on it in the past, but
I've never talked before about its totality.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And there's a reason I didn't do
that, which we'll come to in a minute.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">What we're going to talk about
starts out with something you already know about, which is the stem
system.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">If you've been following my lessons
at all, you know that there is no conjugation in
Japanese.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Verbs just make a small change to
the one kana on the end, changing it from an う-row kana to one of
the four other rows.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And then we attach various kinds of
helpers, helper nouns, helper verbs, helper adjectives.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">But what I didn't explain at the
time I introduced this is that it goes much further than
this.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">I left you thinking perhaps that the
て-form, as it's called, and adjectives have some kind of a minor
conjugation-thing happening that's a bit like European conjugation
and the stuff the textbooks teach.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">This isn't true. I didn't talk about
it too much at the time because I think before you've ingested the
basics properly it could be a bit complicated-feeling and hard to
take in.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">But now let's look at it
properly.</span></p>
<h2 class="c22" id="h.2f1n5481uatn"><span class="c16">Active /
Static words</span></h2>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">As you know, there are two kinds of
words in Japanese, and that is, active, changeable words and static
words.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span style=
"overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 624.00px; height: 350.67px;">
<img alt="" src="images/image194.jpg" style=
"width: 624.00px; height: 350.67px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);"
title=""></span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Active, changeable words consist of
the three kinds of words that can make the engine of a sentence,
that's to say, verbs, adjectives, and the copula.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span>Static words are nearly all nouns, and they
never change at all. They can't change in any way.</span></p>
<h3 class="c11" id="h.qo7ugf3u9sg8"><span class="c29">Only the last
kana changes</span></h3>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Now, all the words that can change,
change in exactly the same way. We have to know two things about
them.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">The first is that nothing changes in
the base form of a word except the last kana.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span style=
"overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 624.00px; height: 350.67px;">
<img alt="" src="images/image261.jpg" style=
"width: 624.00px; height: 350.67px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);"
title=""></span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">That's the う-row kana in a verb or
the い in an adjective.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Nothing before that can change.
That's as fixed and settled and inert as a noun. It's only that
last kana that can ever change and that can then have things
attached to it.</span></p>
<h3 class="c11" id="h.d1lvuvi644tc"><span class="c29">Stem helper
system</span></h3>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">The second thing to know is that
they all change according to the stem-helper system.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So, although I introduced the て-form
as if it was a "form", a kind of morphing or conjugation of the
whole word, it is in fact a stem-helper system of its
own.</span></p>
<p class="c19 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">In real Japanese grammar as taught
to Japanese natives by Japanese natives, た and て are regarded as
helpers, as entities in themselves that attach to the stem of a
word.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So essentially verbs have not one
stem-system, but two stem-systems.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And that's partly why I didn't
introduce it straight away, because that feels a bit overwhelming
at first.</span></p>
<h2 class="c22" id="h.kv9fe92w735z"><span class="c16">The Stem
Systems</span></h2>
<h3 class="c11" id="h.9y3fx17ds7ih"><span class="c29">The て Stem,
the second verb stem-system</span></h3>
<p class="c0"><span style=
"overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 624.00px; height: 350.67px;">
<img alt="" src="images/image220.jpg" style=
"width: 624.00px; height: 350.67px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);"
title=""></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">The second stem-system, that's the
て-stem, you already know. We'll go over it briefly.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">There's the うつる group, and that
changes the last kana, う, つ or る, into a small つ, and then we can
add the た or the て.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">There's the ぬぶむ group: this changes
the last kana, ぬ, む or ぶ, into ん, and the influence of the softness
of those kana and of the ん itself affects in a euphonic manner the
て or the た, turning them into で or だ.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Ku and gu turn into i -- and we're
going to notice in a minute that this relation between i and the
ka-row kana, ka-kiく-ke-ko, is something that continues to play a
role in adjectives.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">We'll look at that in a minute. く
and ぐ turn into い, and in the case of gu, that 〃 on the く, that
soft sound, again has a euphonic effect on the て or た that follow
it, turning them into で or だ.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And finally, su in the て-form does
exactly what it does in forming the い-stem in the regular stem
system: it becomes し.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So, there we have the second
verb-stem system, the て-stem, and we use this not only for て and た,
but also to add helpers like the conditional たら and たり.</span></p>
<h3 class="c11" id="h.kr1vcy47ttgk"><span class="c29">The Adjective
Stem system</span></h3>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So what about adjectives? Adjectives
also have their own stem-system. Adjectives in fact have four
stems.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">You can form adjective stems by
dropping the i, just as we drop the る in ichidan verbs, or by
changing that い to one of three ka-row kana, ka, ke or
ku.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And as we said before, there's a
relationship between ka-row kana and i, so with the て-stem of
verbs, verbs ending in く, the き turns into い, and the same with the
〃 version, ぐ.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So we have four stems for
adjectives, dropping the i or turning it into ka, ke or
ku.</span></p>
<h4 class="c35" id="h.gm4fetuqovta"><span class="c40">The く
Stem</span></h4>
<p class="c0"><span style=
"overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 624.00px; height: 350.67px;">

title=""></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">The く-stem attaches the ない helper
adjective, negativizing the adjective, and also if it stands on its
own -- and as we know, stems sometimes can stand on their
own.</span></p>
<ul class="c13 lst-kix_trq1tw8juze5-0 start">
<li class="c17 c30 li-bullet-0"><span>So the い-stem of a verb on
its own becomes a noun.</span> <span class="c1 c33">(頼む →
頼み)</span></li>
<li class="c17 c30 li-bullet-0"><span>The e-stem on its own forms
the imperative.</span> <span class="c33">(頼む → 頼め)</span></li>
<li class="c17 c30 li-bullet-0"><span class="c1">The く-stem of an
adjective on its own turns the adjective into an
adverb.</span></li>
</ul>
<p class="c0"><span>So, we can say "早い 車" (fast car) or
"</span><span>早く はしる</span><span class="c1">" (run
fast).</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And く is also used, of course, to
make the て-form: we just add て to the end of the く.</span></p>
<h4 class="c35" id="h.48ig1f22wgcw"><span class="c40">The か
Stem</span></h4>
<p class="c0"><span style=

title=""></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">The ke-stem also takes a rider,
which is れ so we have the stem けれ, and to that we attach the helper
ば, which is the conditional (and I made a whole set of videos on
conditionals like ば and たら, and I'll put a link above and in the
information section below).</span></p>
<h4 class="c35" id="h.nljwm5lihgmz"><span class="c40">Dropping the
い</span></h4>
<p class="c0"><span style=

title=""></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">When we drop the -i altogether we
can use it for attaching things like the そう helper noun, which
means that something appears to have that quality, and also to
attach helper verbs like がる.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So to the stem of "ほしい" we can
attach がる to make "ほしがる" (show signs of wanting something, appear
to want something).</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Or to the たい helper we can drop that
い and attach がる and get "たがる" (show signs of wanting to do
something, appear to want to do something).</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So, as you see, adjectives have a
stem-system of their own to which we attach a variety of helpers,
like a smaller version of the one verbs have.</span></p>
<h3 class="c11" id="h.k7nq87iwd879"><span class="c29">The Copula
Stem system</span></h3>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Now, what about the copula? That's
the other dynamic element, the other engine.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span style=
"overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 624.00px; height: 350.67px;">
<img alt="" src="images/image109.jpg" style=

title=""></span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Now, the copula's only one kana to
start with, so generally we add something to that.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">We can add the small tsu, to make
the stem da~, which can then have the た past helper added to it to
make "だった".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">We can add ろ, so it can have the
volitional helper added to make "だろう".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And in the て-form, the だ itself
changes -- of course having only one kana, だ is the last kana --
and that can become "で" to make the て-form.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">It's a little bit less regular than
the others, but that's really because there is only one copula, so
it doesn't have lots of other things in the same group for it to be
regular with.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So, that's the overall structure of
Japanese.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">It has two kinds of words, active
and passive words, transforming and inert words.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">The inert words can't change in any
way, but they can attach particles that tell us what they're
doing.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And fortunately, because they never
change at all, there's nothing tricky about nouns.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">They always attach the same particle
to do the same job regardless of what noun we're talking
about.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Much simpler than foreign
grammatical systems.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Active elements, verbs, adjectives
and the copula, can only change that last kana and they always do
it according to the stem-helper system.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">When we understand that, the whole
thing becomes a great deal easier to conceptualize and deal
with.</span></p>

なんて Nante なんか Nanka など Nado: 3 Common words clarified.</span></h1>
<p class="c0"><span>こんにちは</span><span class="c1">.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Today we're going to talk about
three words that you'll encounter often in your
immersion.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">They have quite a wide meaning
spectrum, and that means that dictionaries can't really cover the
full range of what they mean, especially when, as they often are,
they're used in very colloquial ways.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And I'd like to thank all the people
who tell me which words give them trouble in immersion.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">This helps me to know what to cover
and in what order to cover it.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">A lot of people wanted to know about
"nante" and "nanka".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So if you have words that are giving
you trouble, please pop them in the Comments below.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">It's very helpful to know what it is
that's causing problems.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So, the three words are "nado",
"nante" and "nanka".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">They have different meanings but
they overlap in certain areas.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And the simplest one is "nado", so
we're going to start off with that.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Nado"essentially means pretty much
what "etcetera" means in English, but the thing to bear in mind in
formal language is that it has higher status than "etcetera"in
English.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">In English, "etcetera" tends to be
treated in many cases as a bit of a cop-out.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">It's a way of not really saying
exactly what you mean.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">In Japanese it has much higher
status.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Its meaning spectrum is
broader.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">You will encounter it both in
completely formal writing and in informal conversation and
writing.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">It's an indispensable part of the
language.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">To give an example of its formal
use, a dictionary definition of the word "shasou"-- and "shasou"is
one of these words that I've talked about in a previous video,
two-or-more-kanji words that really aren't words in quite the
English sense of the word, that's to say, they are really
phrases.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">They bring together two known
entities, which are known if we've done much Japanese, into what in
English would simply be a phrase.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So we can throw these words into our
Anki if we want to remind ourselves that they exist but we
shouldn't treat them as completely new entities.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">They're really just like phrases and
this one is very close to the English phrase "car window", which
isn't a word, it's just a phrase.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">If we know "car" and we know
"window", we know what a "car window"is.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So if we know "車" and we know "mado"
and we know the on-readings of the two, which are "sha" and "そう",
then "shasou"really presents no problems, except that we need to
remember that "sha", the on-reading of "車", refers to a broader
range of vehicle.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"車"usually simply means a "jidousha"
(an automobile) while "sha"can refer to any kind of surface
vehicle.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">A bicycle is a "jitensha", a train
is a "densha", etcetera.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And the definition is: "jidousha
nado no mado".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So essentially that means "the
window of an automobile, etcetera", which in this case means any
kind of a surface vehicle that has windows, so not a "jitensha" but
a "densha", etcetera: "the window of a vehicle".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And this "nado"is a very typical use
of the word.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">It gets used freely in formal and
informal Japanese.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">In informal Japanese, "nado" also
has another use, which overlaps with the other two words we're
going to look at.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">It can be used to mildly denigrate
or belittle a word that it's attached to.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Now, "denigrate" and "belittle" are
not exactly the right words to use here, but I don't think there
are quite the right words in English.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">It throws a negative light, which in
the case of "nado"is usually making light of or slightly rejecting
whatever it is.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So we might say, "tabako nado fuようだ"
, which means "I've no use for cigarettes".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Now, "tabakoは fuようだ" would mean the
same thing essentially (notice that "nado"knocks out other
particles).</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">The only difference here is that
"nado"is throwing that slightly disparaging light on
cigarettes.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So the way we could read it is
something like, in English, "I don't need stuff like
cigarettes".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Now, actually this doesn't mean that
literally.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">It's not saying I don't need
cigarettes or cigars or a pipe or a hookah.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">It means I don't need that kind of
thing -- that's something I don't need in my life.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And as I say, this use overlaps with
our other two words.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Both "nanka" and "nante"can be used
in this throwing-a-negative-light-on-the-noun-they-follow
way.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">The strongest and most colloquial of
the three is "nanka", and "nante"comes somewhere in the
middle.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So, "nanka"is really a contraction
of "nanika" (something), but it has quite a few colloquial
uses.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And its denigrating one we'll hear
sometimes very strongly in cases where...</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">well, let's say in an anime a
younger sister is angry with her older sister.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">She may say, "お姉ちゃん nanka daikirai!"
(I really hate stuff like my big sister).</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Now, of course, that's not literally
what she means.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">She doesn't mean she hates "stuff
like" her big sister, but by using this expression --"stuff like
you", "stuff like my big sister"-- you're throwing a very
disparaging light on what it is you're talking about.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">It can be milder: we can say,
"sakkaa nanka kyoumiが ない" (I've no interest in stuff like soccer /
I'm not interested in soccer).</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And it can be more mildly belittling
still: we might say, "ame nanka heiki だ".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And what we're saying there is "Rain
doesn't bother me / I'm not troubled by rain / I'm okay with
rain".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And the "nanka"is just throwing that
slightly diminishing light on the rain, indicating how little we're
worried about it.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And it often gets used of oneself,
as in "私 nanka", and this is often used to stress a perceived
inferior position or a difficult position that one finds oneself
in, for example, "私 nanka まるで 子供 atsukai だ" (I'm treated just like
a child).</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Now, the fundamental meaning of
"nanka", as I said, is actually a contraction of "nanika", which is
"something".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And it can be used simply as a
contraction of "nanika"in, for example, "nanka shinpaiは aru?",
which just means "nanika shinpaiは aru"or (Is there some worry? Is
anything worrying you?).</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Now, from there it goes on to
preface things in order, as with "something"or "somewhat"in
English, to make them a bit vaguer.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So we might say "nanka chigau"
(something's different -- I'm not sure what it is, but something's
different).</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Nanka chigau."Now, from that it
goes on to meaning "somehow".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So we might say "nanka 好き-ja nai"
(somehow, I don't like it / For some reason, I don't like
it).</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Nanka 好き-ja nai."Now, from there it
gets worse.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">It goes on to become even
vaguer.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So in very casual and (I would say)
rather sloppy speech, you can hear "nanka" at the beginning of a
sentence and then several times during the sentence: "nanka this,
nanka that".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And when it's being used like that,
it's really being used like "kinda"or "like"in English.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And, just as in English, this is a
sloppy way of talking.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">It's not good Japanese, but you may
hear people talking like this in some anime, etcetera.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">The function really, as with
"like"or "kinda"in English, is simply vaguing things up a bit and
releasing oneself from the need to express oneself
precisely.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Just kinda saying, like, whatever it
is that kinda comes into your mind, like -- "nanka...</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">nanka...</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">nanka".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So, we should look out for this very
loose use of "nanka" and realize that it doesn't really mean very
much at all.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Nante"is essentially a contraction
of "nantte" and I've done another video about this -tte, which is a
contraction of と or "という".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And it's the same with
"nante".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So, in its simplest and most basic
use, it's used, for example, in saying "nante itta?", which means
"what did you say?"English speakers may be tempted to ask "nani を
itta?" (what did you say?).</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">But that's not natural
Japanese.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">We can say "nan と itta", but it's
actually more natural in casual speech to say "nante itta?" (what
was it that you said?) which isn't very easy to translate into
English because it's using that quotation particle even though it's
rather morphed itself into "nante"in colloquial speech.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Now, you'll also see it a lot with a
meaning of "what"in English as used in expressions like "what a
nice day!", "what a stupid person!", "what a beautiful
flower!"etcetera.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And this is an abbreviation of "nan
という", but it's more often than not, even in not particularly casual
speech, used as "nante".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Nante 美しい keshiki da!" (What
beautiful scenery!) And, just as in English, this "nante"can be
used to introduce any fairly strong reaction to
anything.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">It can be negative; it can be
positive.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">We're saying "what a (this)"or "what
a (that)".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Now, it's also used, as we said
before, in this belittling manner attached to a noun.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So, for example, we can say "shiken
nante kirai だ" (I hate exams); "okane nante iranai" (I don't want
money).</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Like "nanka", it both stresses the
noun that it follows and indicates a negative or a dismissive
attitude towards it.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And it can also be used at the end
of a complete statement to express surprise.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So in this sense it's rather like
the first one we looked at, the "what a (this)"or "what a (that)",
which comes at the beginning.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">It can also be used at the end to
express surprise or in some cases disbelief or doubt.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So we might say, "fuyuに tsubame を 見る
nante" (see a swallow in winter + "nante").</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">What's that "nante"doing? Well, it's
turning the whole thing into an expression, rather like the "what a
(this)"or "what a (that)"expressions.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So what we're saying is something
like "Gosh, imagine seeing a swallow in winter!" and this use of
"nante"on the end, after the engine of a statement, can be used as
part of a longer sentence.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So, for example, we could say " hara
を tateru nante kimi らしくない".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Now, " hara を tateru" means
literally "stand your stomach", but this is an expression meaning
"get angry".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So the whole thing is saying
"getting angry, that's not like you".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And I've talked about this "rashi"
and "rashi kunai"in another video.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So, if you're not familiar with
those, I'll put a link above my head and in the information section
below.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Now, we can take out the "nante"
here and then of course we'd have to put in a particle and say, "
hara を tateru-noは kimi らしくない".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">But the "nante"is expressing our
surprise about this because it's not like the person
concerned.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And note that this can't be the
belittling "nante", which attaches to nouns.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">This is attaching to a complete
statement, so we're expressing our surprise about someone being
angry and then adding the comment that it's not like
her.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And finally, we can use it in a way
that comes right back more or less to the original meaning of
"という", but adding a bit of vagueness to it.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So if we say " や mada nante hitoは
shiranai", we're saying "I don't know anyone called や
mada".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Now, the "nante" here could be
replaced simply with "という": " や mada という hitoは
shiranai".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So what's the difference between
using the regular "という" and using "nante"? Well, " や mada という hitoは
shiranai"is like saying in English simply "I don't know a person
called や mada".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">But " や mada nante hitoは shiranai"is
more like saying "I don't know any character called や
mada".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">It's throwing a lot more doubt and
questioning into the whole thing.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So, we've covered the main usages of
these three words or expressions here.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">It's not completely exhaustive, but
I think it gives you the basic keys to how they work, what they
mean, how they're used.</span></p>

words that trouble you, please mention it in the Comments below and
I'll respond.</span></p>

<h1 class="c15" id="h.cbh5h5q560t"><span class="c18">Lesson 83:
Three Levels of Command in Japanese: て-form commands, なさい,
な-commands, imperative form.</span></h1>
<p class="c0"><span>こんにちは</span><span class="c1">.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Today we're going to talk about ways
of making commands and requests in Japanese.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">You'll probably know some of these
already, but I think we're going to go a little bit deeper to some
things you may not have realized.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">We're going to go from the least
commanding and intense towards the most, so we'll start off with
one that we all know, which is the て-form.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Some sources will tell you that the
て-form on its own is a command or request form.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">That's only half true.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">It's the abbreviation of a command
or request.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">If we say "ちょっと 待って" (wait a
little), this is an abbreviation of "ちょっと 待って ください" (wait a little
please) and probably because of this it's the one that's least
likely to be offensive, although it's still casual.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Now, sometimes you'll hear people
saying not "ちょっと 待って" but "ちょっと 待ってte".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">What's going on here? Essentially
what they're saying is "wait a little bit and I'll be
back".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">The implication is that the waiting
period will end fairly shortly.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And what this actually is is a
contraction of "ちょっと 待って ite".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">As we know "matte いる" means "exist
in a state of waiting", "be waiting", in English.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So "ちょっと 待ってte"is actually taking
this "matte いる" and putting it into て-form, so that what you're
being asked or instructed to do is exist in a state of
waiting.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And the implication of this is, just
exist for a little bit in a state of waiting.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And of course this doesn't have to
be waiting, it can be anything, but the implication is, just do it
for a bit, just exist in that state for a short time.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">If we don't say "chotto" (and we
don't necessarily) there's nothing to indicate a short time, but
that is always the implication of telling someone with the て-form
to exist in a particular state.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">The other thing to know about the
て-form which is used to tell or ask someone to do something is
that, as we know, the equivalent negative adjective of any verb is
made by simply attaching the helper adjective "ない" to the
a-stem.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And the helper adjective "ない"
actually is unusual in that it has two て-forms.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">It has the regular て-form, which is
formed just like any other て-form, by attaching て to the く-stem, so
that's "nakute", but it also has the irregular て-form
"ないで".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And when attached to a verb this is
only used in two kinds of circumstance.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">One is when we say "do B without
doing A", so " 話さないで 歩く" means "walk without talking".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">The other is when we're making that
て-formed command or request.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And again it's short for "ないで
ください".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So if we say "nakaないで" (don't cry),
that's using this secondary, specialized て-form of "ない" , which is
specifically there for making negative commands or requests, as
well as for the one other usage that we discussed.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And sometimes in anime you'll hear
someone scream, when a monster is approaching her, "koないで!" (don't
come).</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">In English we'd probably say "Keep
away!"In Japanese we say "Koないで!"Now, next up in our hierarchy of
commands is "nasai".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Nasai"is attached to the い-stem of
verbs, and when you attach "nasai" to the い-stem of a verb, you
make it into a command.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So, "okinasai"is "get up / wake up"
; "ochit好きnasai" (calm down, settle down), we're attaching "nasai"
to the い-stem of "ochitsuku", which means "calm down"or "settle
down" and turning it into a command.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Nasai"is the sort of command given
by parents to children, teachers to a class, that sort of
thing.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">It's not offensive if it's given by
someone who's entitled to give it.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So, for example, in the anime
"Kari-gurashi no Arietti", Arietty's father says
"nenasai".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">That's the い-stem, which of course
with ichidan verbs we make by simply removing the る , of "neru"
(sleep, or go to bed) plus "nasai".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Something that can be confusing here
is that there is an abbreviation of "nasai" which can be confused
with a different abbreviation meaning the opposite.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And that abbreviation is
"na".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">When we attach "na" to the い-stem of
a verb, then we're actually abbreviating "nasai".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So if we say "junbi shina", we're
saying "junbi shinasai" (get ready, get prepared) : "junbi する",
い-stem of "する", "shi"+ "nasai"or "na".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Now, that in itself isn't
particularly confusing.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">What can confuse people is that if
we say, for example, "bakaに する na" (don't make fun of me, of her);
"sore を 食べる na" (don't eat that! [could be poison]).</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">This means the opposite! We're using
"na"for both a command to do something and a command not to do
something.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So how do we tell the two apart?
Fortunately, it's very easy.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">If the "na"is attached to the
い-stem, then it's an abbreviation of "nasai".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">It always is.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">If it's not attached to the い-stem
but attached to the entire logical clause as in "sore を 食べる na",
then it is not an abbreviation of "nasai".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">It's in fact an older negative
related to "ない".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So really, although they can seem
confusing at first and they're probably confusing when you're told
by some textbook just to learn which particular forms they stick
to, it's not really confusing in practice.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">One only attaches where "nasai"
would attach to the い-stem, and that's the one that means "nasai"!
The other one tops off a complete logical clause with the
negativizing "na".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And now we come to the real command
form, "meireikei"in Japanese.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And this is formed very simply by
using the bare e-stem of a godan verb or, in the case of an ichidan
verb, we take off the る as always, and replace it with
-ro.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So you might hear people say in an
anime "Damare!" that is the verb "damaru" (to be quiet, to be
silent) turned into a command: "be quiet!" and this is really
pretty forceful.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">It's stronger and potentially more
offensive than "urusai!" (And I made a video on "urusai"if you want
to follow that up.) It's not inherently offensive.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">If someone really has the right to
be giving orders, they may use it.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And people who talk rough may use it
among friends or to enemies.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">You may hear it a lot in shounen
anime, where people do tend to talk rough.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">It can also express urgency in a few
cases.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">One case that you'll often hear is
when a character is in serious trouble and calls out "tasukete
kure" which is like "tasukete ください" but turning it into a real
order, a command.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Now, obviously someone in deep
trouble isn't trying to insult or offend anyone who might help
him.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So what this "kure"is doing in this
case is expressing the urgency of the situation.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Yet even here, I'd have to say that
I've only ever heard male characters use this "tasukete
kure".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Female characters, even in the
direst emergency, will tend to content themselves with "tasukete!"
and this shows how delicate the real "meireikei"command form
actually is.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Kure"is really the only irregular
"meireikei" apart from the two regular irregulars, which are "する"
and "kuru".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So "くれる" (to give down / to me)
becomes "kure".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And, as you see, it's a particularly
touchy kind of word to use, because you're asking for a favor but
you're demanding it, you're commanding someone to do a favor down
to you.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Now, for completeness, I'd say that
there are two other ways of commanding that are mostly used for
other things but can be used as command forms as well.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">One is the "no だ / n だ" ending which
is put on the end of a complete logical clause, and I've made a
video about this "no だ / n だ" ending, and I'll put a link to that
over my head and in the information section below.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">As I explain in the video, it has a
wide range of uses, but one of those uses is turning something into
a command.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So if we say "shukudai を する no だ" ,
we're saying literally "It's that you do your homework".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">This will be somewhat like the
English "You're going to do your homework".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">It's a command.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Also, "ように" , which as an ender
would tend to be more associated with prayers and petitions and
requests, can also form a command.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And the main reason I mention these
is because if you come across them in your immersion and you see
something that usually is doing something else looking like a
command, "no だ" or "ように" , then don't be puzzled by it.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">In these cases, it is a
command.</span></p>

<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And if you have other questions or

<h1 class="c15" id="h.yke20xl9043"><span class="c18">Lesson 84: である
and the Structure of Japanese. What older copulas tell us: である,
であります、でござる、でございます</span></h1>
<p class="c0"><span>こんにちは</span><span class="c1">.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Today we're going to talk again
about that element of Japanese that gives us the key to about a
third of all Japanese sentences, and that is the copula.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Now, I've talked quite a bit about
the copula before and I'll put links in the information section
below so that you can fol low that up.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">But today I want to look at slightly
less commonly used versions of the copula which you are going to
see quite a bit in your immersion and that raise certain questions
about the structure of the copula itself which we're going to
address.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">These are: "de aru", "de ariます", "de
gozaiます" and "de gozaru".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Now, we can deal with the last three
very quickly, because all of them are just variants of the first
one, "de aru".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"De ariます"is obviously "de aru" with
the "ます" helper verb attached.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"De gozaru" -- "gozaru"is simply a
polite, keigo version of "ある", the verb of being.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Now, how does the verb of being get
into this? Well, we'll talk about that in a minute.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Gozaru"is simply made up of the
honorific "go"plus "zaru", which originally means "seated", but has
the extended meaning of "existing".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So "gozaru"is just "ある" in fancy
form.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">You won't hear "de gozaru"very much
at all because since it's an honorific form these days it's nearly
always used with the "ます" helper verb attached.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">But you will hear "gozaru"perhaps in
period drama and things like that.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">It's samurai talk.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"De gozaiます"is the form of the
copula that's used in keigo, so you'll hear it in shops, you'll
hear it in public announcements, and you'll hear it used by
speakers in anime etc who are using very honorific speech, perhaps
subvillains talking to the main villain.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So that's really all we need to say
about those three.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">But "de aru", which is the root of
all of them, is the one we need to pay attention to.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">You could call it, in a way, the
"straight copula".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"だ" sounds casual, "です"is polite,
but "de aru"is just the copula.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">We see it used in contexts where
we're simply being objective, such as academic papers, newspaper
reporting, that kind of thing.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">We'll also see it used in other
contexts regardless of what register the writing is in because it
has a particular quality.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">As we know, "だ" and "です"can only be
used at the end of a logical clause.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">They are logical-clause endings and
they can't be used to pre-modify a noun.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">If we want to pre-modify a noun with
another noun marked by the copula, we can only do that if it's an
adjectival noun, because adjectival nouns can use the pre-modifying
version of the copula, which is "na".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">We can say " hanaが きれい だ" (flower
pretty is) or we can say "きれい-na hana" (pretty-is
flower).</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And it's precisely because this
group of nouns -- and I've talked about the three groups of special
nouns in another video if you'd like to look at that -- this
particular special group of nouns, adjectival nouns, has the
property that it's able to use the pre-modifying form of the
copula, "na".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">This is something that the textbooks
don't seem to know.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">They don't tell you what "na"is and
they tell you that adjectival nouns are actually some weird thing
called "na adjectives".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">But that's another
matter.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So what do we do if we want to use a
copula-marked noun as a pre-modifier and it isn't an adjectival
noun? Now, we don't do this an awful lot because we can work around
the situation by using "の".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">But in some cases either this
doesn't work or it just isn't what we want to do.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So, suppose we want to say "Sakura
who is a university student".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Now, we can say "大学生 の Sakura",
which is "the university student Sakura".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">But suppose we don't want to say
that.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Suppose we actually want to say
"Sakura who is a university student"? It's not quite the same, in
Japanese or English.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">In order to do this we have to use
the copula and we have to use it as a pre-modifier, so we have to
use "de aru".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">It's our only choice.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">We can't use "だ" or "です" because
they can only be used at the end of a logical clause.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And we can't use "na" because
"大学生"is not an adjectival noun.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So we say "大学生であるSakura".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And you'll see that sometimes,
especially in written material.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">But there are cases where you really
don't have the choice at all.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">For example, if you want to say "the
state of being round", you would say "enkeiであるsama".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Now, "sama"is a state or
condition.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">We can't really use の here; "enkei の
sama"doesn't really work.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So we really have to say
"enkeiであるsama".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Now, when I say that "de aru"is the
straight copula, not the casual one, not the polite one, just the
straightforward copula, there's another reason for this, because
ultimately and historically "だ" is simply an abbreviation of "de
aru" and "です"is an abbreviation of "de ariます".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So, if you've followed my course, if
you've been trained up to look at Japanese structurally, there are
certain questions that this may make you want to ask, and some
people have asked me.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">First of all, haven't I presented
the copula as an indivisible, special unit, one of the three
engines, but here it seems to be made up of two elements, "で" and
"ある", and it looks very much like a verb.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So what's going on here? And then,
why in any case do the elements "で" and "ある" add up to the concept
of the copula? Now, let's look at this second part first and then
we'll look at the first part.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Why do "で"plus "ある"make the copula
concept? Well, as we know there are two "で"s in
Japanese.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">There's the particle "で" and then
there's the て-form of the copula.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">The textbooks don't tell you
this.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">They let you think everything is the
particle "で".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">But as we know there are two
"で"s.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Now, the one we're dealing with here
is obviously the particle "で".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">It can't be the て-form of the copula
because the fundamental copula can't be made up of two elements,
one of which is already the て-form of itself.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And in order to understand what's
going on here, why "で" and "ある" add up to the copula, we need to
know two things.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Now, I've made videos on both of
these and I'll link them as well, but let's just recap it
here.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">The two things we need to know are
first of all what the copula actually is, and the second is what
the particle "で" actually does.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">What the copula actually is is
something that takes two nouns, A and B, and tells us that noun A
is part of a set represented by noun B.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">That's what the copula
does.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">That's all it does.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So if we say "さくらが 日本人 だ" we're
saying Sakura (noun A) is part of the set Japanese people (noun
B).</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And sometimes the set can be a set
of one.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So if we say "that person over there
is Sakura", then we're saying that that person over there belongs
to the set of one which is Sakura.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">We're not talking about other
Sakuras.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">We're talking about this particular
Sakura.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So now, what does the particle "で"
actually do? I've made a video about that and I'll link
it.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Fundamentally the particle
"で"defines the limit or field or parameter within which an action
takes place or a state of being prevails.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So the simplest use of "で"is to say
where an action takes place: "公園 de 遊ぶ" (play in the park) -- the
park, which is marked by "で", is the field, the area, the
parameters, within which I play; "sekai de ichiban おいしい raamen"
(the most delicious ramen in the world) -- the world marked by
"で"marks the field, the area within which this ramen is the first,
number one.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And it gets extended a bit further
in other cases.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">It could be the material something's
made with, the tool something is made by, etc.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">In all cases it singles out a
particular parameter from other parameters that allow the making to
take place.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Now, when we take "de aru", what
this is saying is exist (aru) within a particular boundary or
parameter; in other words, exist within a set.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And that's what the copula tells
us.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">It tells us what set, what boundary,
something exists in.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Sakura exists within the boundary of
Japanese people.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">If we say "washiが tori だ" (an eagle
is a bird) we're saying an eagle exists within the boundary, within
the parameter, within the set, "birds".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And this is what the copula always
does.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So "de aru"is a very precise
construction of the copula.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So let's get to the second
question.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">The second question is, does this
mean that it isn't really an indivisible element of Japanese, one
of the three engines? And does it mean that it's a verb? Because
obviously "ある" is a verb, and it's because "ある" is a verb that we
can use it as a pre-modifier.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">We can say "大学生であるSakura" because
you can always use a verb to pre-modify a noun.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And the answer to the question is
that this is a question of modeling.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">I model Japanese in a particular
manner.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">It is possible to model it in other
manners.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">In Japanese grammar as taught to
Japanese students, the copula is regarded as a verb.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And in fact an adjectival noun plus
the copula is called a "keiyoudoushi", which means an adjectival
verb.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">The "verb"part is the copula which
is added to it.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So "きれい"is not a keiyoudoushi; "きれい
na"or "きれい だ" is a keiyoudoushi.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And the "doushi"part, the verb part,
is the copula.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">But I do not model the copula as a
verb.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And the reason for that is that in
our three-engine structure I restrict the term "verb" to those
entities that end in う-row kana and do all the things that those
entities do: we have the four stems, etc.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">The copula doesn't work like this in
modern Japanese.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">It works differently.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"De aru" has evolved into an entity
in itself with its own て-form, which it has, with its own
connective form, "na", which it has.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">We could, if we wanted to, model all
three engines as verbs, because in many ways adjectives are also
verb-like.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">But they don't work like the
u-ending entities and they don't work like the copula.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So, within my model of Japanese,
which I think is the best one for non-native learners of Japanese
to use, we use the three-engine structure.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">We regard verbs, adjectives and the
copula as three unique entities.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">This is not a statement about the
etymology of Japanese.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">It's not even a statement about the
"real truth"of Japanese grammar, because there is no "real truth"in
grammar.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Grammar is simply a means of
describing a pre-existing phenomenon, which is language.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Grammar is not the source code of
language.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Grammar is an attempt to describe
language by modeling it.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And I use and recommend the
three-engine model.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">If you prefer another model, you're
free to use it.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">The other reason I maintain that
distinction is because it's very important not to confuse "で" which
is the て-form of the copula with the particle "で", and it's very
important not to confuse the concept of the copula with the verb of
being, "ある".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And that happens all too easily to
English speakers or people who are very familiar with English,
because in English the copula and the verb of being are represented
by the same word, and that's "is" and its variants "was", "am",
"are", etc.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">They're the same word, but they're
not the same concept.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So when we say that "だ" and "です"mean
"is", this is a confusing way of looking at it.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">They don't mean "is"in all
circumstances; they mean "is" when it's the copula.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So if we say "that animal is a
rabbit", this is the copula.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">We're placing "that animal"into the
set "rabbit".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">If we say "there is a rabbit",
that's not the copula, it's the verb of being.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">We're saying a rabbit exists, there
in that place.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Now, because these two concepts are
very easily confusable, and because textbooks and even more
advanced academic texts do a very, very poor job of differentiating
them, I believe it's important to keep the copula, which is an
unfamiliar concept in English, because English has no dedicated
copula, to keep it separate in the three-engine model.</span></p>

<h1 class="c15" id="h.mynrgjv9ukj3"><span class="c18">Lesson 85: まい
the negative helper that never gets explained properly</span></h1>
<p class="c0"><span>こんにちは</span><span class="c1">.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Today we're going to talk about an
unusual but not uncommon element of Japanese that you'll certainly
come across in your immersion.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">It can be confusing because nobody
really explains exactly what it is and what it does -- and of
course they certainly don't explain why.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">A number of people have asked me
about this recently including my Red Kokeshi patron Bob Nagler, who
says, " have you ever done a video of verb plus 'mai'? I've not
found a very useful explanation anywhere, only lists with examples
and translation which give somewhat of an idea." well yes, that is
pretty much the state of play.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So let's do the video
now.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Mai"is a negative helper like "zu"
and "nu", which I did a video on quite recently.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And like them it's something of a
fossil, one of those elements that's not quite at home in modern
Japanese.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">But it's used quite a lot, so we
need to understand it.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">The first unusual thing about it is
that unlike most helpers, it doesn't attach to one of the verb
stems.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">It gets stuck straight onto the end
of the verb in most cases.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So if we want to put it onto "行く" we
just say "ikumai".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">This is always the case with godan
verbs because there's no other way of attaching "mai".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">With ichidan verbs we can attach it
to the universal ichidan stem (as you know, with ichidan verbs we
always, whatever we're doing with them, we always just take off the
る and put on whatever we want to put on).</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So, for example, "見る"can become
"mimai", but just as often it's "見るまい".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">With the two irregulars, "kuru" and
"する", they can be "車i" and "するmai", but they can also be "komai"
and "shimai".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Now, strictly speaking, certainly in
the past, using ichidan verbs in their entirety with "mai"on the
end was probably ungrammatical, but now it's so widely done that
it's generally accepted.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">You'll see it everywhere on the
television news or anywhere.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So what is this "mai"? Well, it's
really a sort of sister to the helper adjective "ない" , which is the
negativizing adjective.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">What's the difference between "mai"
and "ない" apart from the way it attaches? Well, what "mai" actually
is is the volitional form.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Now, adjectives don't usually have
volitional forms, but in this case we do, and it has certain
uses.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Like "ない" , "mai"is an adjective,
but unlike "ない" and just about every other adjective, it doesn't
morph in any way.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">You don't say "makute"or
"makatta".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">You only ever use it in its simple,
unchanged form, "mai", so it is, in a way, a static element in
Japanese, not an active element.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And this actually is quite natural,
because it's the same with the positive volitional, isn't it? We
have て-forms and past forms of helpers like the receptive and the
causative and, of course, "ない" itself, but we don't have past and
て-forms, etc., of the volitional.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">" 食べよう": you don't put that into the
past, it doesn't have a て-form, because that doesn't really make
any sense with a volitional.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So what does a negative volitional
actually do? It doesn't do all the things that a positive
volitional does.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">You can't use it as a call to
action: "行きましょう" (let's go).</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">You can't say "ikumai" (let's not
go) -- it doesn't mean that.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">You can't use it for, as I've shown
in another video, forming a construction that means "try to do
something".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So you can't use "mai"in
let's-try-not と -do-type constructions.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Its uses are pretty limited; it has
a couple of direct uses and then a couple of other uses which are
really quite useful.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So, let's look at them.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Its most usual use by a long way is
saying that something is unlikely.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">It's a volitional negative, so just
in the same way that we can voice conjectures or assessments -- and
this is very often used with the verb "ある", so we say
"arumai".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Sonna ことは arumai" (that's just not
likely / I don't think such a thing is probable at all).</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">But it works just the same with any
other verb.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Kono furi dewa kareは komai" (in
this downpour, I doubt if he'll come).</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And this is rather related to the
other adjectives of subjectivity that we've discussed elsewhere
(and I'll put a link for that), such as "ほしい" , which represents
our desire for something, or "怖い" which represents our fear of
something.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">As usual, these adjectives are
pointed at the thing that we desire, that we fear, etc.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And in this case, they're pointed at
the thing that we consider unlikely.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">It represents really our
subjectivity about the likelihood of something.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">If we want to give an exact Japanese
equivalent, "arumai"is directly equivalent to "nai darou" (doesn't
exist, I conjecture) or "nai でしょう", and "dewa arumai"is directly
equivalent to "dewa ない darou", "dewa ない でしょう", "janai darou",
"janai でしょう", in other words, "a isn't B, I would conjecture, it
seems likely"etc.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And the interesting point here is
that, as we see, with this conjectural use of the volitional in its
positive, more usual form, we don't attach the volitional directly
to the verb that we're conjecturing about.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So we don't say "Sakuraは suguに
kaerou".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">That doesn't mean "Sakura will
probably come".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">We say "Sakuraは suguni kuru でしょう (or
darou)", because that's the way we do it.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">We do it with the volitional copula
when we're making that kind of conjecture.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">But with "mai" we can attach it
directly to the verb as we did in the previous example.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Sonna ことは arumai"is directly
equivalent to "sonna ことは ない でしょう".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And there's no room for ambiguity
here because "mai" has a more limited range of meanings, as we've
just discussed, than the positive volitional has, so we're not
going to get confused with, say, a call to action, because
"mai"doesn't do calls to inaction.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So, the most common use of "mai"is
as the negative adjectival of these "でしょう/darou"conjectural
constructions.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">However, it is also used for one
other negativizing structure that is directly equivalent to the
positive.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So we can say "nido to ikumai" (I
won't go there again; literally, I won't go a second
time).</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">That's the other common
meaning.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">When it's not expressing a
likelihood or possibility, it's expressing a strong decision or
determination not to do something.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Now, beyond these few uses, there
are also a couple of other common constructions in which "mai"is
used, and you're pretty much certain to hear these.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">One uses the positive and negative
volitional forms together, meaning whether the verb is done or
not.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So, for example, "行こう ka, ikumai ka"
means "whether I go or not".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Now, this is very similar to a
construction that we've talked about before and that you probably
know already, "iku ka dou ka" which means literally "whether I go
or how", which in more natural English would be "whether I go or
what".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Now, the other construction that
you'll commonly hear is formed by simply attaching "shi", which is
used for listing causes of something, but as we've discussed
elsewhere, it's often used on its own just to imply a continuing
list.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And this gives a construction that's
somewhat comparable to the "it isn't as if..."or "it isn't
like..."construction in English.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So if we say "kane mochi dewa arumai
shi" which is roughly equivalent to the saying in English "it's not
as if we're rich", or "sekaiが owaru wake arumai shi" (it's not as
if the world is going to end).</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">That's how we'd put it in
English.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">In Japanese, it's more like saying
"it isn't that we're rich or something like that" (that's the
"shi", the something like that).</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And the volitional is again marking
a negative hypothetical.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Someone might act as if the world
were going to end, but in fact it probably isn't.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">We might look to some people as if
we're rich but, well, we don't seem to be, do we? So this is how
the "mai" helper works in its various different common
uses.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">If you've seen any other uses and
would like to discuss them, please put it in the Comments below,
and if you'd like me to talk about any other elements of Japanese
that you find confusing, please put that in the Comments below as
well.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And of course, if you have any
general comments or questions, those go in the same
place.</span></p>

<h1 class="c15" id="h.sqgxqu8nicr4"><span class="c18">Lesson 86: 次第
(次第) - What it really means and how it really works.</span></h1>
<p class="c0"><span>こんにちは</span><span class="c1">.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Today we're going to talk about one
of those words that has a huge list of apparently unconnected
meanings, if you take the English-Japanese dictionary seriously,
which makes it feel very difficult.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">But as is usual in these cases, the
real problem is simply trying to fit the square peg of English
definition into the round hole of Japanese.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So, if we take a look at the word
we'll be able to understand what it really means and how it really
works.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">The word is "次第".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">According to the dictionary, it can
mean "depending on", "as soon as", "immediately upon", "in
accordance with", "order", "program", "precedence",
"circumstances", "course of events".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And then we have what the
conventional textbooks like to call a "grammar point": "次第に", which
means "gradually"in the sense of gradually progress into a
state.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So, how do we make sense of all
this? Well, let's start by looking at "次第".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"次第"is made up of two kanji and it's
a noun.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And you ought to know that as soon
as I say it's made up of two kanji and nothing else, we know that
it's a noun.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">That's all it can be.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And the two kanji are: this first
one, which is the kanji we use in "tsugi" (next), and that's what
it means, "next".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And this one, "dai", which is the
Japanese ordinal.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Now, what's an ordinal? In English,
an ordinal is the -st in "first", the -nd in "second", the -rd in
"third", the -th in "fourth"etc.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">In Japanese, fortunately, we only
have one ordinal for every number and it's "dai", and we put it
before the number, not afterwards.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So if we want to talk about the
third episode of an anime we say "daisan wa"; so the "dai"is the
-rd, the "san"is the three, and "wa"is the counter for stories or
episodes.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So, we have the "tsugi"kanji, the
"next"kanji, whose regular on-reading is "shi", and we have "dai",
meaning "ordinal / sequence / number in sequence".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So what it means is "next thing in
sequence / next thing in order".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And one more thing we need to know
about this word is that it generally works by attaching to another
noun.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And this gives us a kind of
compound.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So if we attach "時計" to "ude",
"ude"is telling us about the "時計".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Udedokei"is an "arm-clock" (a
wristwatch).</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">If we attach "suna" to "時計" then we
have a "sand-clock" (an hourglass).</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And similarly we form these
noun-compounds with "次第" and whatever it's attached to.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And the simplest use of this is
where it replaces the English expression "as soon as"or
"immediately upon".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So, if we say, "wakari-次第 odenwa
します", we're saying, "as soon as it becomes known...</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">(" 分かる", become known; literally, do
known, do understandable)...</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">As soon as it becomes
understandable, I'll call you." what you see that we have here the
い-stem of "分かる" (do understandable), which is "wakari", and we're
creating a compound noun, which means "next thing in sequence after
doing understandable is that I'll call you / As soon as it become
understandable, as soon as we know the situation, I'll call
you.""Shokuji の youiが deki-次第 食べる."So, although here we actually
have a logical clause: "Shokuji の youiが 出来る" (preparations for the
meal are completed; literally, come out), we actually have the stem
of "出来る" here, which is "deki", and that's attached to
"次第".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So, "the next thing in sequence
after the preparation's been completed is eat / As soon as the
preparations for the meal are finished, we'll eat".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And from this logic we then get what
seems to be a completely different idea in English, which is
"depending upon".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So we might say, "それは tenki-次第
だ".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">In English we'd say "that depends on
the weather".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">But in Japanese what we're saying is
"that follows directly from the weather".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And, as you see, it's a different
way of putting it, but it means fundamentally the same
thing.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Kare の kotaeは kibun-次第 だ."Now, that
means " his answer follows directly from his mood".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">In other words, his answer depends
on what mood he's in.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And a useful phrase to know here is
"te-atari-次第".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">" te-atari"is "て" (hand) and "atari"
(touch or contact).</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">" te-atari-次第" means "whatever one
can lay one's hands on / whatever comes to hand".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So, "te-atari-次第 本 を yomu" (I read
whatever book comes to hand).</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Reading a book follows directly from
hand と uch of a book, literally.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">" te-atari-次第"can be used in all
kinds of constructions: I eat whatever comes to hand; I read
whatever comes to hand; I throw whatever comes to hand at the
neighbors.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And, as you see, it's the noun-form
of this verb (touch) "ataru", which is "atari", which attaches to
"次第".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Another useful trick is that we can
attach "次第"directly to a person.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So if we say "anata-しだい です", we're
essentially saying "it's up to you / it follows directly from
you".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Now, this wouldn't be expressed in
English as "depends on", and in fact if we wanted to say "it all
depends on you"in Japanese, we'd have to use a different kind of
construction altogether.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Within the Japanese meaning
spectrum, what "anata-次第 だ" means is "it follows directly from
you": It's up to you, it's not up to anyone else, it doesn't follow
from me, it doesn't follow from anybody else, it follows directly
from you, it's up to you.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">The important thing to understand
here is that while the English meaning spectrum and the Japanese
meaning spectrum differ, in Japanese terms we're dealing with the
same fundamental idea all the time.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">It's not a random selection of
ideas, the way it looks as if it is when you see it in an
English-Japanese dictionary.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">From here we get meanings like
"according to": "nedanは shina-次第 de chigau", which literally means
"the price differs directly following the goods".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Now, if the goods are the same,
which they usually are in this kind of a construction, then it
would mean the quality of the goods, just as "tenki-次第" means the
quality of the weather, the type of weather, and "kibun-次第" means
the quality of somebody's mood, the type of mood.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So, "shina-次第" means the type of
goods, the quality of goods.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Now, we can still use the
"depending" translation here and not the "according to"
translation.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">We could say, "the price depends on
the quality of the goods".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">However, if we use an expression
like "mibun-次第に kurasu", we're saying "live according to one's
station in life, according to one's means".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">We can't use "depend" here in
English, but as you see as far as Japanese goes it's exactly the
same idea.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Mibun"isn't quite translatable, but
it means one's position in life, one's status, and it can,
particularly in modern times, mean how much money one
has.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Now, in some cases, and this is
where it becomes a little more extended, "次第" (next in sequence)
can represent the whole sequence.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So in these cases it can mean things
like a process, a set of circumstances, a course of
events.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So one might say, "それは こんな 次第 だった"
(it was this kind of situation, it was this kind of a sequence of
events).</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Now, we also have what the textbooks
would call the "grammar point", "次第に".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">This is simply the standard practice
of taking a noun ("次第"is a noun) and using it adverbially to
describe a verb.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And doing something "次第に", in a
"次第"manner, is as a sequence of steps or gradually.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So, "Cheshaa 猫は 次第に kieta" (The
Cheshire Cat disappeared gradually).</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Or "yoruは 次第に nagaku なる" (the nights
are growing longer, day by day, step by step).</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And this always implies a process
taking place over time either in definite stages or not, but taking
place over time, bit by bit.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And because this is put forward as a
"grammar point", it can be a bit confusing.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">What we need to notice is that not
every use of "次第" that is followed by に corresponds to this
so-called grammar point.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">The real issue here, which doesn't
tend to get explained, is that when "次第"is not modified by another
noun and it's on its own acting as an independent adverb, that's
when it has this meaning.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So, in the example we saw earlier,
"mibun-次第に kurasu", that isn't an example of this.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">It is being used adverbially, but
what's modifying "kurasu"is not "次第"on its own but the compound
"mibun-次第".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So these are the fundamental uses of
"次第".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">They seem very different if you look
at them through English glasses, but if you look at them as they
are, I think we can see that "次第" works pretty much the same way
all the time.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">If you have any questions about
"次第"or any other words that you'd like me to discuss, please put
them in the Comments below and I will answer as usual.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">If you have any other questions or
comments, of course, they go in the same place.</span></p>

<h1 class="c15" id="h.fghs4kwolenv"><span class="c18">Lesson 87:
Japanese Structure INVERTED: the strange life of しか. How it really
works.</span></h1>
<p class="c0"><span>こんにちは</span><span class="c1">.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Today, I'm afraid I don't have any
reindeer for you, but I do have a few deer.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">We're going to talk about the word
"shika", which, as you probably know, means "deer", but there's
another "shika"element in Japanese which is a particle and which
has a rather unusual effect on the structure of
sentences.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So we're going to look into that
effect.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">One of my commenters reminded me of
a rather charming Japanese word play: "nara nara shika shika
叱らrenai", and in natural English we would translate this as "In
Nara, only the deer get scolded".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">It's useful to know here that Nara
in the Kansai region is famous for its deer.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">People go to Nara to see the deer
(and for other things -- it's a lovely historical city).</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Strictly, "Nara nara"doesn't mean
"in Nara".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">It means "if it's Nara"or, more
naturally, "in the case of Nara".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">But what does the rest of the
structure mean? This is what my commenter was really
asking.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">The question was, "what is the A-car
of this sentence? Does it have a zero-A-car somewhere, or does it
even have an A-car at all?" what is the A-car of a sentence like
this? Now, the problem is partly that "shika" has an unusual effect
on the sentence structure, but it's also that the receptive helper
is used here which makes it look a bit more complicated than it
is.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So let's start off with a very
simple "shika"sentence.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Sakura shika inai."In natural
English we'd translate this as, "there's nobody here but Sakura."So
what's "shika"doing here? "Shika"does two things in a sentence like
this.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">It knocks out the が particle just
like "ka", so this isn't something that we're not already familiar
with.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">When you have "ka"in a sentence
where there would also be a が, we never say "ga ka"or "ka
ga".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Ka"displaces が, but the が is still
logically there.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">That's what "shika" also
does.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">But the other thing "shika"does is a
little bit more unusual.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">I don't know if you've ever used
Photoshop, but in Photoshop you can invert a selection.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">What happens is that you select an
object, you press the key selection to invert that selection and
what happens is that everything outside of that object is
selected.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">The object is the only thing there
now that isn't selected.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">This is exactly what
"shika"does.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">While が, you might say, selects an
object, a noun, and marks it as the A-car, the subject of the
sentence, "shika"selects that noun, inverts the selection and marks
that as the A-car of the sentence.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So everything other than that
selected noun is now the A-car of the sentence.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So, "Sakura shika inai"literally
means "Everyone other than Sakura is not here".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">In the deer sentence, which looks a
little more complicated, it's exactly the same thing: "nara nara
shika shika 叱らrenai" (if it's Nara, everything other than the deer
are not scolded).</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So again, we're selecting the deer,
inverting the selection to everything other than the deer, and then
that becomes the A-car of the sentence, which is "not
scolded".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Now, there's also an implicit
relevance clause in this, so when we say "Sakura shika inai" we
don't mean there's nothing here but Sakura: no trees, no bushes, no
flying saucers.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">We mean there's nobody here but
Sakura.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Now, the "inai"partly tells us that,
but it isn't just that, because it also doesn't mean that there are
no bunny rabbits here, there are no birds, there are no capybara
(did I pronounce that right?) So "shika"inverts the selection, but
it's also what you might call a "smart invert": it selects for
relevance.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">However, in some "shika"sentences
there is actually a が marked subject, so what's going on here?
Let's take a look at one.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Suppose we say, "taoruが ichimai
shika arisません".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Again, in natural English: "there's
only one towel here." the が marked subject is "towel"or
"towels".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">In Japanese, of course, there's no
distinction between those two things.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And as I explained in my lesson on
counters, a counter in this kind of sentence is working as an
adverb.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">It's telling us more about the
engine of the sentence, the verb.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So if we say "dorobouが san'nin いる",
we're saying "robbers exist three-person-ly".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">If we say "taoruが ichimai aru",
we're saying "towel one-flat-thing-ly exists".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">If we say "taoruが nimai aru", we're
saying "taoruが two-flat-thing-ly exists".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So when we say "taoruが ichimai shika
arisません", the subject is "towels", then we have the counter
"ichimai" and that is marked by "shika".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So we're selecting one flat thing,
one towel, and then inverting the selection to all
towels.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Not all flat things, because we've
already marked the subject as "towel".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So we're inverting the counter,
which is working adverbially, from one towel to every towel but
that one towel.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So we're saying "towels, everything
but one, non-exists".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">In natural English, "there's only
one towel".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And that's how what we might call
the inverse-selection structure of a "shika"sentence
works.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And I should just add at the end
that there is a use of "shika" that's more colloquial.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And this is when we say "shika
nai".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Now, in an ordinary "shika"sentence
obviously we just say "kono furui 車 shika nai", which means in
natural English "there's only this old car." we're selecting the
car, inverting the selection: "all cars other than this old car
non-exist".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">But we can also put that "shika
nai"on the end of a logical clause or a verb standing in for a
logical clause.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Now, this isn't strictly
grammatical, but colloquially it often happens.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So if you hear in an anime somebody
saying "nigeru shika nai!", they're saying "we gotta run!"in
natural English.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">What they're literally saying is, we
take this "nigeru", we mark it with "shika"so that what we're
selecting is not "nigeru" (run) but everything else other than
run.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And again, the relevancy smart
selection comes in here.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">What we're really saying is "every
course of action other than running doesn't exist".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Well, of course it does exist, this
is very colloquial, but as far as we're concerned it doesn't exist:
there's nothing for it but to run.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">In English we might say, "It's run
or nothing", and again, that's ungrammatical and for the same
reason that the Japanese is ungrammatical, that "run"isn't a
noun.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">But, when that thing's coming after
you, who cares about grammar? If you have any questions or
comments, please put them in the Comments below and I will answer
as usual.</span></p>

<h1 class="c15" id="h.5f8uj3bjwkw4"><span class="c18">Lesson 88:
The Indestructible Core of Japanese. How the logic never fails.
Xをしたい vs Xがしたい</span></h1>
<p class="c0"><span>こんにちは</span><span class="c1">.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Today we're going to talk about the
core fundamental structure of Japanese and a problem that troubles
some people about it, which I've tried to lay to rest but there's
still some difficulty, I think, so I'm going to try to tackle the
question, for what I hope will be the last time, today.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And in doing that we're going to
look at a puzzle that's posed by the title of a very popular
work.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">It's been a manga, an anime, a
live-action movie: "きみ の suizou を 食べたい" , which means literally "I
want to eat your pancreas", and we'll talk about why it literally
means that in a minute.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">I didn't actually know what a
pancreas was.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">I thought it was a railway station
in London.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">But apparently it's a component that
you find inside the human body and things don't go so well without
it.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">I'm not very clear on what you find
when you take off the front and back panels of a human body, so we
learn something new every day! That's why this is classified as an
educational channel, I suppose.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So, the question that will be raised
by this title in the minds of anybody who's got some grasp of the
real structure of Japanese, is: Why is the particle を, rather than
the particle が, used here? If we want to say what in English would
be "I want to eat that bread"or "I want to eat that cake", we would
say "panが 食べたい" , "ケーキが 食べたい".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And, as we see, the adjective "たい" ,
the adjective of desire "たい" , is pointing not at me but at the
cake.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">The cake carries the が particle, so
that is what the adjective is describing.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And confusion ensues when we
actually translate this as literally meaning "I want to eat cake",
because that's not what it means.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">It means "cake is want-inducing (to
me)".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">But we also know that this adjective
of subjectivity, like other adjectives of subjectivity, like "怖い"
(frightening), and also potentials like "出来る"or "食べられる"-- because
potential is also a kind of subjectivity.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">It's something peculiar to the
individual, whether they can or can't do a particular
thing.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">It's not inherent in the thing
itself.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">That would be "kanousei".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">We know that all of these generally
point at the thing that's possible, the thing that induces the
desire to eat, the thing that's scary, etc.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">But also the polarity can be
flipped.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And it's flipped particularly when
there isn't an actual cause, an actual visible or tangible cause of
the subjectivity.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So if we say, "o-nakaが suita 早く
食べたい" , we're saying "tummy is empty, I want to eat
soon".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Now that "たい" is pointing at me, not
at any particular thing, like cake or anything else.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Now, this is the point that a few
people have actually resisted and said, "well, can't we say that
it's not really saying 'I want to eat', it's saying 'food in
general is making me want to eat'?" well, it isn't
actually.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">It's your empty tummy that's making
you want to eat.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And we're going to look at some
constructions today, and the one we've just talked about is one of
them, that make it a 100% clear that not only in cases where there
isn't a cause of the subjectivity, but in some cases where there
is, the adjective of subjectivity can still flip its
polarity.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Now, why do people resist this idea?
As a matter of fact, it's not unknown even in English.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">We can say "we were happy that day",
in which case the adjective " happy"is pointing at us (we're the
ones that were happy) or we can say "that was a happy day", and now
the adjective of subjectivity is pointing at the day, which is the
cause of our happiness.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">We can say "I am suspicious of her
behavior" and the adjective "suspicious"is pointing at me (I'm the
one who's suspicious) or " her behavior is suspicious", and now the
adjective "suspicious"is pointing at her behavior as the cause of
my subjectivity.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So this isn't something that doesn't
happen, even in English.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">For the reason, I think, that people
become so agitated about this and so determined to find quite
unlikely ways of wriggling out of it is perfectly
understandable.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">It's because they may have spent
months or even years in this terribly confusing world where
particles just change their meaning depending on which side of bed
they got out of that morning.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So, "が usually marks the subject of
a sentence but it can also mark the object of a sentence as in
'panが 食べたい', in which obviously the bread isn't the subject of the
sentence; it's me, 'I want to eat bread'." well, we know that this
isn't the case.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">We know that in those cases it's the
bread that's the subject; it's the bread that's making me want to
eat.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And if we start saying "that the
polarity can flip, doesn't that either break the model of Japanese
structure that gets rid of all these ambiguities or introduce new
ambiguities so, ooh there are special rules that sometimes it
points this way and sometimes it points that way", well, the answer
to that is no, it doesn't matter to the model.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">It's quite irrelevant to the
model.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Whether we choose to say "panが 食べたい"
(bread is making me want to eat) or "pan を 食べたい" (I want to eat
bread) doesn't matter.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">The only thing that matters to the
model is that the particles are always doing the same
thing.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">If we say "panが 食べたい" , we're saying
the bread is making me want to eat.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">If we say "pan を 食べたい" , we're
saying that I want to eat bread.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And the model doesn't care which way
we say it.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">The model is doing the same thing
either way.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">All the particles are doing exactly
the same thing.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Now, can we justify this
grammatically? So if we say, for example, "pan を 食べたい" , surely the
problem here is that with "たい" we have an adjective, so we have an
adjectival sentence, and an adjective, as we know, can't take a
direct object.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So how can we say "pan を 食べたい" ? And
the answer to this is really very simple.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Japanese, as we know, is very adept
at gluing verbal elements together to make them into one element or
taking them apart at will.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And what's going on in a sentence
like "pan を 食べたい" is that "たい" is no longer being attached simply
to the verb "食べる".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">We're not saying "panを" and then
"食べたい" , we're saying "pan を 食べ..." and "たい" is being attached to
that entire unit.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">What we want is the action "pan を
食べる", so we can attach the "たい" to that entire unit.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">That's what makes sense of these
constructions.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And while "pan を 食べたい" is a less
common way of putting it, and in general "naninani を 食べたい" is the
less common way of putting it, there are some kinds of sentence in
which it is the one that we always use.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">For example, "tasuketai" (want to
help) or "mamoritai" (want to defend).</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">We don't say "さくらが mamoritai", we
say "Sakura を mamoritai".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And if we're talking about "seigi"
(justice) or " heiwa" (peace) or even "kuni" (country), it's the
same.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">We don't say Sakura is making me
want to defend her, we don't say the country is making me want to
defend it, we don't say justice is making me want to defend it, or
peace is making me want to defend it.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">We always say "I want to defend
Sakura", "I want to defend justice", "I want to defend peace", "I
want to defend the country".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Why is that? Well, essentially I
think the reason is that we are not talking about an impulse
desire.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">If we look at bread and we want to
eat it, "ah, panが 食べたい" (bread's making me want to eat
it).</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">But we're talking here about things
that are more abstract, things that are less impulsive.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And in the case of people, it's more
respectful to say "Sakura を mamoritai" than "さくらが mamoritai",
because we're not saying that Sakura is an object that makes me
want to defend her, like a piece of bread that we might want to
eat, we're saying that the action of defending her is something I
want to do, which is more dignified in the case of a
person.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">But in the case of, say, the
country, or peace, or justice, or even a house or a park, we're
talking about something less impulsive and more a decision of our
own, if not a conscious decision, then a mindset, a way of thinking
that is ours.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So we talk about that action as our
own rather than something induced by the external cause.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">If we do say "pan を 食べたい" , this is
likely to be in conditions where we're talking a little bit more
generally, we're not talking about that particular lovely smell of
bread by which the bread is making us want to eat it.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">We're not talking about some candy
we've just seen that's making us want to eat it.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">We're talking about the general
desire to eat bread.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So we're more likely to say "pan を
食べたい toki" (when I want to eat bread) than "panが 食べたい toki" (when
bread makes me want to eat it).</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And this isn't a firm and definite
rule but this is the kind of tendency, the kind of reason, the
nuance, which decides which way we're likely to flip that adjective
of desire, in this case, "たい".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So if we come back to "きみ の suizou を
食べたい" , why is を being used here? Well, essentially because again
this is not an impulse eat.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">We're not looking at the girl's
pancreas and thinking how delicious it is.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">That would be rather hard to do
anyway.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Something subtler, something more
abstract, something deeper, is being talked about here, the desire
for some emotional and quite complex reason to eat somebody's
pancreas.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So I hope this time we really laid
to rest the final question of polarity switching.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">It does not threaten the
model.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And it does happen.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And it happens for reasons which are
a little subtle, that will probably take time to ingest and
immersion to ingest, because you can't learn everything through raw
structure.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">If you have any questions or
comments, please put them in the Comments below and I will answer
as usual.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">I'd like to thank my Gold Kokeshi
patrons and all my patrons and supporters, who make these videos
possible.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And I'd like to thank you for

<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Once again, I'm so happy that so
many of you support this channel.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">One of my commenters pointed out
recently that while the channel is still pretty small in terms of
subscribers and views and things like that and is outpaced many
times over by channels that simply rehash the conventional view,
the engagement of this channel is many, many times higher than most
of those channels.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">More of you become patrons, more of
you comment, more of you "like" the videos.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So we have a small but dedicated
group here, and I think that's kind of natural because we're doing
something very radical and it takes time for radical things to
catch on.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And it's not as if I have a winning
personality to bring you all into the fold.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">I'm perfectly well aware that my
personality and charisma are on the level of a budget
toaster.</span></p>

<h1 class="c15" id="h.fpi4rqcacghz"><span class="c18">Lesson 89:
De-mystifying Japanese. Let the world's most logical language
shine! The Universal Subject</span></h1>
<p class="c0"><span>こんにちは</span><span class="c1">.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Today we're going to talk about
something that is the very basis of Japanese and that we've talked
about right from the very first lesson.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And that is, the grammatical
subject, what we call, in train language, the "a-car".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And as we know, every Japanese
sentence has to have an A-car, a subject, a "shugo"in Japanese, and
a B-engine -- that's the predicate, or the "jyutsugo"in
Japanese.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">In other words, every sentence is
saying something about something.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Now, some people argue that there's
no subject in Japanese; some teachers do this, including Tae
Kim-先生, and generally this is because they don't have a very good
grip on how the language actually works.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Some Japanese people, a minority of
linguists, also propose a noすbject model for Japanese.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">As I've said before, grammar,
structure, models, whatever you want to call them, are not the
source code of language.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">They are means of describing
language after the event.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So it may be possible to devise a
model for Japanese that doesn't use the idea of the subject, but
really this is just going to be shuffling terminology
around.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">I had a Japanese person rather
angrily coming into my Comments and saying that I'm Westernizing
Japanese by bringing in the concept of the subject.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Now, I think if you know my work,
you know that I don't Westernize Japanese.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">I teach Japanese as
Japanese.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Whether nonすbject models are really
valid or not, I don't know.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">I haven't looked into
them.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">But what we do need to show is that
the subject model that we use and that most Japanese linguists use
works and works all the time, completely, reliably and
predictably.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Some languages are termed
"nullすbject languages"in linguistics, which doesn't really mean
they haven't got subjects, it means that their subjects aren't
always visible, which is exactly what we have in
Japanese.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">In Spanish, for example, we don't
generally say, "yo soy Americana", although we're taught to do that
by the textbooks.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And the reason we don't is that
"よ"is redundant.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Soy"implies "I", so if we just say
"Soy Americana", that's all we need to say.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Everything else is
redundant.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">The same is true in
English.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">If we say "I am American", we
actually don't need the "I", because "am"implies "I".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">We don't use "am" with anything
other than "I", so the "I"is redundant.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">It's just that English doesn't
permit you to drop it.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So it's just a matter of
rules.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Japanese doesn't work this way,
because Japanese doesn't have conjugations like "am / is /
are".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">In fact, it doesn't have any
conjugations at all, despite what the textbooks say.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">In Japanese the null subject is
determined entirely from context.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And when context doesn't make it
clear, it generally defaults to "I".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">This is almost exactly what English
"it"does, except that "it"in English isn't zeroed.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So if I say "It fell from the sky /
It ate my breakfast / It's half the size of the other one", you
have no idea what "it"is unless context supplies the
answer.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">This is how the zero-pronoun works
in Japanese.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">The fact that we can see and hear
"it" and we can't see or hear the zero-pronoun makes no difference
to all of this. So if we take the kind of sentence that people try
to call "subjectless", let's take a sentence like
"tsukareta".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Now, literally this just means
"tired", so it could be called a subjectless sentence, but it
absolutely isn't -- unless you want to avoid the term "subject"for
reasons of your own.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">When we say "tsukareta", we're not
saying that the rabbit in the moon is tired.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">We're not saying that Mickey Mouse
is tired.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">We're not saying that tiredness
settles like a purple haze over the known universe.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">We are saying "I am
tired".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">If that wasn't the case, Japanese
wouldn't be a language, because we couldn't do the basic thing that
a language needs to do, which is to make Statement B about Thing
A.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">If I look at a girl and say "きれい-na
no ne?" again, I am not saying that the rabbit in the moon is
pretty or that life in general is pretty.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">I have a very clear subject known to
both myself and the hearer.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Now, there are cases where we have
an indeterminate subject, and some people might try to argue that
these at least are our mystical subjectless Japanese
sentences.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">But actually they're no different
from their English equivalents.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So we might say " hare そうだ" , which
means "it looks like being fine".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And you can ask "what looks like
being fine? The weather, the day, this part of the world?" there
isn't an exact answer.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And of course this is the same in
English and Japanese.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">The subject is
indeterminate.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">In English we know there's a subject
because its place is held by "it".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">What about Japanese? Are we just
shoehorning a subject in? No, we aren't.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Notice "だ" , the copula
"だ".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">We all know what "だ" is (and if you
don't, I'll link a video so that you can follow it up).</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">The copula tells us that one thing
is another thing.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">If we say "Roses are flowers / Mary
is an artist / Today is Saturday" we're joining one thing (the
subject) to another thing (the predicate), or the A-car to the
B-engine.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">This is what "だ" does and it's all
that it does.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So we know that this sentence has a
zeroすbject even though it isn't place-marked by "it".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">We can't see it, we can't hear it,
but we know for a fact that it's there, because without it "だ"
makes no sense at all.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Now, there is actually one kind of
sentence in Japanese that really is subjectless.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">You can find it in English too, but
it's a little more common in Japanese -- but not all that
common.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And it's a sentence like "Osakaに
tadoritsuita Sakuratachi"or " hazukashiku なった Hanako".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">These are not in fact sentences, and
they wouldn't be seen as sentences by most linguists in
Japanese.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">What they are is simple modified
nouns.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So we're saying "arrived-at-Osaka
Sakura and friends".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">We're not saying "Sakura and friends
arrived at Osaka".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">We're simply saying "Sakura and
friends" and modifying them with the modifier
"arrived-at-Osaka".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">" hazukashiku なった Hanako"-- We're
not saying " hanako became embarrassed", we're saying "Embarrassed
Hanako".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">When do we use "sentences"like this?
Well, not very often, but they can get used in narrative, because
what they're essentially doing is either summing up something that
went before -- you particularly often see this in, say, games where
when you load up they give you a quick resume of what's already
happened -- or where you're describing the result of something
that's happened: "and the result was, an embarrassed
Hanako".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">This really is, I think, the only
example we can find of what might be called a subjectless sentence,
but it's not really a subjectless sentence because it's not a
sentence.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">It's simply a noun with a bit of
modification.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So if you encounter these, and you
will encounter these from time to time if you're doing immersion,
you haven't found a subjectless sentence, you have found a
particular narrative technique that occasionally gets used in
Japanese.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">It certainly doesn't add any
strength to the arguments of people who say that there's no subject
in Japanese, because these are a very small minority of so-called
sentences and they certainly don't influence the fact that a real
sentence that's telling us something about something always has an
A-car and a B-engine, a subject and a predicate.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">If you have any questions or
comments, please put them in the Comments below and I will answer
as usual.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">I'd like to thank my Gold Kokeshi
patrons, who make these videos possible, and all my patrons and
supporters on Patreon and everywhere.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Thank you all for making this
possible and for helping us to dispel the myths and confusion and
the general fog that surrounds Japanese.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">I think there's a feeling in the
West that Japanese is somehow a foggy language that doesn't work
like other languages, and there are one or two Japanese people who,
perhaps for nationalistic reasons, for wanting to stress the
uniqueness of Japanese, play up to this idea.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Well, that doesn't really matter
because their audience is fundamentally Japanese people whose
Japanese isn't going to be ruined by a strange model of the
language.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Yours, on the other hand, is best
kept on the strait and narrow of straightforward subject-predicate
analysis.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Thank you for watching this
lesson.</span></p>

<h1 class="c15" id="h.5ozcuqesw37p"><span class="c18">Lesson 90:
Japanese Punctuation: How it REALLY works.</span></h1>
<p class="c0"><span>こんにちは</span><span class="c1">.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Today we're going to talk about
Japanese punctuation.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Now, the first thing we need to know
about about Japanese punctuation is that most of it is a relatively
late arrival in Japanese.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Most of it came in during the Meiji
era, about a hundred and fifty years ago.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">This was when Japan was modernizing,
and a lot of the reason it came in was to help in translating
Western literature.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Now, what this means is that in most
cases Japanese punctuation doesn't have such fixed and structural
meanings as the equivalent punctuation does in English and other
European languages.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So, we need to know what the
punctuation is doing and also what it isn't doing.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So, the first mark we're going to
look at is the Japanese full stop or "maru", which looks like a
little circle at the foot of a letter.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And this is really the exception to
the rule, because it really is structurally clear.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">What it does is end a
sentence.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And this is very important for us in
understanding how complex Japanese sentences are
structured.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Why is that? Well, Japanese is a
very modification-heavy language.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">That's to say, a lot of what other
languages do by other strategies, Japanese does by modification,
that's to say, using clauses to modify nouns or other elements of a
sentence.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Most of the heavy lifting in
Japanese structure that's not done by logical particles is done by
this modification structure.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So whole logical clauses can be used
not as logical clauses but in order to modify a noun or some other
element.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So, let's take a look at how this
works.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">"Ichibaで katte kawaに otoshichatta
okashi." and this means "the candy that I bought at the market and
done dropped in the river".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Now, the problem with this when
we're reading a complex sentence is that we can get confused about
whether something is a logical clause or not.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So, are we saying here that I bought
something at the market? No, we're not saying that.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Are we saying that I dropped
something in the river? No, that's not what we're saying in this
sentence.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Both of those things are just
modifying "okashi".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">They're telling us what kind of an
"okashi"it was: the one I bought at the market and done dropped in
the river.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So all we have here is a single
noun, "okashi", that's been heavily modified by logical clauses
that aren't working as complete logical clauses.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">We can then add a logical particle
to that "okashi" and make it into a whole logical
clause.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So, we might say, "Ichibaで katte
kawaに otoshichatta okashiが sakana-sanに 食べrareta." (The candy I
bought at the market and done dropped in the river got eaten by a
fish.) But how do we ensure when we're reading a sentence like this
whether we're looking at a logical clause or whether we're looking
at a modifier? Now, the important thing to understand here is that
in any kind of Japanese writing (except perhaps on Twitter or
something) a logical clause has to end in one of two ways, either
with a "maru", which tells us that it's the end of the complete
sentence -- it may have a couple of sentence ender particles after
it, but it's a very strict rule of Japanese that what ends any
logical clause is the B-engine, aside from any sentence-ender
particles -- or it has to end in a clause connector that completes
the clause and leads into the next clause.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">This may be the て-form, it may be a
word like からor "keredo", but armed with that information we can
then see what's going on.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So, let's look at "Ichibaで katte
kawaに otoshichatta".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">That's a complete pair of logical
clauses.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">It's not telling us what it was that
we bought in the market and dropped in the river, but it could
perhaps be presuming that.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">But we know that it's not in fact a
logical clause because it doesn't end in a clause connector and it
doesn't end with a "maru".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">It goes straight into a
noun.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And this is how we can tell the
difference between a modifier and a logical clause.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And we know when the entire
sequence, the entire sentence, is over because it's going to have
that "maru".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And I've done a video about this
method of analyzing Japanese sentences and I'll link that so that
you can follow it up afterwards.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">But the "maru" here is
vital.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Now, the next one we're going to
look at is the Japanese comma, which looks like a little diagonal
line at the foot of a letter.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And that's kind of the opposite of a
"maru", because it really is not a logical element in the
sentence.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">It was adopted into Japanese, but
unlike the English comma or other European commas, it has no
logical rules.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Ideas like sectioning off a
subordinate clause with commas at each end, that doesn't exist in
Japanese.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">You just put in a comma wherever you
want to indicate a pause.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And that's all it does.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">In Japanese schools, students are
discouraged from using too many commas, and the reason for this is
not incorrect comma usage, because there is no such thing as
incorrect comma usage in Japanese.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">The reason is that commas are not a
structural part of Japanese, so students are discouraged from using
them as a crutch in conveying their meaning.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">If you can't convey your meaning
without commas, then you're not writing good Japanese.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Now, the next one we'll look at is
the question mark or "？ (はてな)".</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Now, in English the question mark is
subject to a rule.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">If you have a question, you have to
end it with a question mark.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And also in English, questions are
structurally different from statements.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So if we say, "the coffee is hot",
that's a statement, but if we say, "Is the coffee hot?" that's a
question.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">In Japanese we don't have this
differentiation.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Statements and questions are
structured exactly the same.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Now, in formal Japanese we have the
question-marking particle "ka", which tells us that it's a
question.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">But in informal Japanese we can use
"ka" but mostly we don't.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Sometimes we use the question-marker
"の", but that's ambiguous because "の"can also be a statement
marker.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">The only way you can really tell a
question from a statement in Japanese is the rising intonation,
which of course you can't hear in text.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And so the question mark has become
a very useful tool for indicating that rising intonation, for
telling us that this is a question, not a statement.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">In English, you have to use the
question mark at the end of a question if you're writing proper
English.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;In Japanese, there's no such
rule.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">If the "ka"marker is there, you
don't use the question mark, but if you want to disambiguate the
fact that something is a question rather than a statement, you just
pop in a question mark if you want to.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">The next thing we'll look at is
quotation marks.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">These look like little square
brackets at the ends of a statement, and they work exactly the same
as English quotation marks.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">They just tell us that something is
a quotation: it's what somebody's saying.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">We don't use them for what
somebody's thinking, as we sometimes do in English.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Now, sometimes you'll see double
quotation marks like this, and what they do is mark a quotation
that occurs inside another quotation.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Now, the last thing I want to talk
about is something that really puzzles people quite a
lot.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">In Japanese, particularly Japanese
books, you'll sometimes see, especially in vertical text, a set of
little marks that look a bit like Japanese commas, running along
the left-hand side of a word or a phrase.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">What on earth is this doing? Nobody
seems to tell you.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">What it is actually doing is either
emphasizing that word or phrase or telling us that it's being used
in a special sense.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So what these little marks are
really doing is something like putting something into italics in
English.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And I suspect they came into
Japanese in the first place to render italicization when
translating Western literature.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">There's no way of really writing
Japanese characters in italics.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">There is no italic format for
Japanese, so this is what's used instead.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">This emphasis and the indication
that something's being used in a special sense can also be
indicated by katakana, but you will see this from time to time in
Japanese texts and that's what it means.</span></p>
